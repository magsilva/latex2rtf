    This fixes a bunch of minor bugs. There probably remain several, 
    but latex2rtf works much better now in many situations.

r1166 | prahl
    add support for setspace package. Hacking this in revealed problems 
    with how \\ was handled an the end of lines and also

r1135 | prahl
    Fixes for odd scoping problems.  These were exposed by
    bib_style.tex and carefully delineated for me by Wilfried.
    These problems have been around for a long time.  
    The bugs have not really been noticed before because we had
    not looked carefully.  These fixes may introduce other
    regressions and have not be thoroughly tested.

r1134 | whennings
    corrected unintentional changes in GPL copyright header in xrefs.c

r1133 | prahl
    This patch adds support to version 2.1.0 for the \bibstyle{...} command.
    It simulates the natbib.sty features invoked for different styles,
    principally mimicking the \bibpunct for each style, and varies
    particular numeric bibliographies to have alternative numeric
    punctuation (for example, "1." rather than "[1]"). (Patch by G. Helffrich).

    documentation updated for delimiters used with the -M32 option

r1131 | prahl
    silence warning

r1127 | prahl
    use \[ ... \] instead of $$ ... $$
    replace \begin{eqnarray} with \begin{align}
    all changes to streamline MathType conversion

r1126 | prahl

    of the languages that were supposed to be supported

r1118 | prahl
    fix for command option -i

r1117 | paaguti
    Trivial change in the Makefile to make it more Debian friendly
    Included $(DESTDIR) and moved the drive specification to the
    lines which define the different directories. It's the only
    magic needed, the rest happens in debian/rules if present. 

r1116 | prahl
    fix bug when parsing brackets [text {]} more text]

r1115 | whennings
    Updated Makefile for move of file inc_test.tex from /cfg to /test

r1114 | whennings
    In styles.c commented out lines 135-136 because the extra blank is unnecessary.
    Extended file test/style.tex
    Moved file inc_test.tex from /cfg to /test

r1113 | prahl
    revert changes to style.cfg because they don't work with MS Word under Windows

r1112 | prahl
    Use Title Case for all style definitions
    Remove extra blank at in rtf header following style definition
    This should help OpenOffice

r1111 | paaguti
    Include DeclareGraphicsExtensions in cfg/ignore.cfg
    until a better solution is found

r1110 | prahl
    tighten up comments from the last check in.  Looks great otherwise.

r1109 | whennings
    In graphics.c, changed path delimiter handling.
    In graphics.c, fixed creation of temporary file names.
    Updated documentation.

    Basic docs for ignore package in cfg/ignore.cfg and a test file for

r1078 | whennings
    in chars.c, formatting two more overstrike unicode characters to Stix font
    
r1077 | whennings
    removed cfg/direct.ucs.cfg (no longer needed)
    in chars.c, formatting most overstrike unicode characters to Stix font
    
r1076 | prahl
    reverse the zero-width overstrike unicode character order.
    I am not sure this is better.  Looks just as bad in Word
    2004 for the Mac.
    
r1075 | paaguti
    Moved ignored package list ignore.cfg
    Consolidated ignored package treatment
    
r1074 | prahl
    I commented out the Apple specific image conversion code.  Something is wrong with the
    sizes.  We just rely on gs now.
    
r1073 | prahl
    Remove spurious style warnings.
    
r1072 | prahl
    nearly complete support for OT2 input encoding.
    Fix bug in unicode input with spacing
    Add four test files for cyrillic
    
r1071 | prahl
    First step towards supporting multiple encodings in one latex file.
    remove g_font_encoding_name 
    remove g_charset_encoding
    add CmdFontEncoding()
    add DefaultFontEncoding()
    add CurrentFontEncoding()
    These all refer to the encoding being used in the latex file.
    
r1070 | prahl
    add enumerate*, description*, and itemize* as environments
    simplify filename processing at in the main program
    
r1069 | prahl
    remove all use of the Symbol font during conversion.  Rely on
    unicode for all our needs.
    
r1068 | prahl
    remove executable property from greek.tex
    
r1067 | prahl
    fix repeated headers in the auto-generated table of contents
    There are missing numbers in the auto-generated table, but the actual
    headers are right.  The problems seems to be that latex emits headers
    without the numbers in the text, but incorporates them in the table of
    contents.  I don't see any easy solution.
    
r1066 | prahl
    eliminate cyrillic and latin2 output encodings.  We only use unicode now.
    simplify fonts.cfg by removing above fonts.  
    move Times     -> Times New Roman
     Helvetica -> Arial
     Courier   -> New Courier 
    because those fonts tend to have more complete Unicode character sets.
    
r1065 | prahl
    reduce size of colortable in the header when the color package is not explicitly used.
    
r1064 | prahl
    finished removing the use of the overstrike field.  Eliminated
    unused code and simplified existing code.
    
r1063 | prahl
    More movement to unicode.  Using combining characters to avoid
    the clumy overstrike in Word.  With this check-in, MT Extra is
    no longer used by latex2rtf. 
    
r1062 | prahl
    adding Wilfried's changes to direct.cfg and ucsymbols.tex
    
r1061 | prahl
    fix problem when \textbf{} is at the start of a new paragraph
    
r1060 | prahl
    Fix font size in Title
    
r1059 | paaguti
    Not yet included in Makefile for compilation. It's just
    a proposal of how we could create an RTF layer 
    
r1058 | prahl
    When I fixed the rest rtf style header, I changed how one must 
    indicate fonts in the .cfg files.  Basically, now we must use
    \f*Unicode* whereas before we used just *STIXFonts*
    
r1057 | prahl
    properly convert \char representation of backslash in
    typewriter font.
    
r1056 | prahl
    partial solution to the style vs font problem.  This removes
    a brace at the beginning of every paragraph and one at the 
    end.  This change is pretty significant and probably breaks
    a bunch of stuff, but a quick perusal of misc4.tex does not
    reveal serious problems (aside from selecting the wrong 
    character when in the typewriter font).
    
r1055 | paaguti
    Careless me... a family and a project are sometimes too much..
    
r1054 | paaguti
    cleanup in CmdHarvardItem: use the ignore.. macros
    and a switch-case construct to make code more readable
    add harvardand to comment/documentation
    
r1053 | prahl
    test file illustrating the problem with styles
    
r1052 | prahl
    revert font changes added to vertical.c
    
r1051 | whennings
    removed problematic double definitions of heading styles 
    from funct1.c and style.cfg.
    Added file styleAPA.cfg
    
r1050 | prahl
    fix seriously broken style header.  This does not fix the problem
    arising from conflicts between fonts and styles.
    rename style 'HTML Formatted' to 'verbatim' because most usage has
    nothing to do with HTML.
    
r1049 | whennings
    In Makefile, cleaned options from CFLAGS line 8 which are already either in PLATFORM
    or in line39
    
r1048 | paaguti
    WIN32 inside UNIX made little sense... reverted that
    
r1047 | paaguti
    I use winmake.bat to call make in my MinGW environment
    Defining the variables in winmake.bat is complemented
    by the ?= assignments in Makefile
    
r1046 | paaguti
    mea culpa, I tried to fclose(NULL) in utils.c
    
r1045 | paaguti
    Orderly bail-out when latex2png can't be called
    Previously there was an exception
    
r1044 | paaguti
    a further step towards better portability in Makefile
    xrefs.h last line without CRLF
    graphics.c: yet another step towards understanding where the
    failures in MINGW come from
    
r1043 | paaguti
    small glitch detected in one of the reorder_citations calls.
    more comments to document change better
    
r1042 | paaguti
    Constants in ScanAux make the code more readable.
    They are used in reorder_citations too.
    
r1041 | paaguti
    changed string tokens with integer ID in ScanAux
    
r1040 | paaguti
    closing } in the acronym style was missing...
    
r1039 | paaguti
    run make depend to refresh dependencies
    ScanAux doesn't use g_aux_name anymore
    
r1038 | paaguti
    Cleanup acronym rests from this header file
    
r1037 | paaguti
    move the loading of the auxfile to label and biblio management
    cleanup: remove old ScanAux code
    
r1036 | whennings
    in acronym.tex, removed blank before \acroextra
    
r1035 | paaguti
    Another step before getting rid of the original ScanAux code
    once and for all.
    
r1034 | paaguti
    Moved the graphicspath test to an independent file
    Minor changes in Makefile to improve portability (hopefully)
    
r1033 | paaguti
    portable my_fgets() in auxfile.c after tests with win32
    (taken from xrefs.c)
    
r1032 | paaguti
    move harvardcite parsing to LoadAuxFile functionality
    
r1031 | paaguti
    compiler complained about missing CRLF at end of file
    
r1030 | paaguti
    these files are needed for the graphicspath test
    
r1029 | paaguti
    final integration of the graphicspath functionality
    I have included the test for it in my acronym.tex
    test file
    
r1028 | paaguti
    first step towards \graphicspath support
    parse the arguments and put them in a string array
    use acronym.tex to test it
    
r1027 | paaguti
    Implemented file searches as loops using GraphConvertTable
    
r1026 | paaguti
    Define a table to handle graphics conversion
    in a uniform way. Better integration of new
    formats and uniform treatment of all formats
    make the effort worthwhile
    
r1025 | paaguti
    first step towards uniforming the graphics interface.
    added int at the end of PutPngFile() in order to have
    the same parameters here as in the other Put...File()
    functions
    
r1024 | paaguti
    final cleanup of the acronym orgy
    
r1023 | paaguti
    defined a paragraph style for the acronyms which resembles
    most what LaTEX uses. It is based on Normal and gets part
    of the formatting (tabs) in vertical.c
    Inserted code in vertical.c to fit this style into the textwidth.
    Prepared a callback in acronyms.c to eventually honour the maximum
    length acronym hint
    
r1022 | paaguti
    move all acronym functionality to acronyms.c
    take CommandArray from commands.c
    take functions from xrefs.c and funct1.c
    redirect \usapackage{acronym} handling in preamble.c
    acronym commands are enabled with an extra Environment
    to make them available only when \usepackage{acronym}
    is invoked
    enable acronym handling in auxfile.c
    NOTE: portions of xrefs.c and funct1.c disabled with #if 0/#endif
    will disappear in the next wave of patches. 
    
r1021 | paaguti
    this is the first step towards parsing the .aux file once
    I'm testing with labels, which are pretty consistently implemented
    right now. 
    commands.c : hook in the CmdNewLabel function
    auxfile.: simplify and parse \newlabel only
    xref.c: new layer to ScanAux: go for the original implementation
    for everything except labels. Treat labels using the label table
    which is created the first time a label is needed by parsing the
    auxfile once.
    
r1020 | paaguti
    added the possibility of getting the whole label definition unparsed
    this is a step towards getting rid of the current ScanAux function
    
r1019 | paaguti
    simplified .aux file handling
    
r1018 | paaguti
    Moved TRUE/FALSE definition from cfg.h to main.h
    main.h is included everywhere, while cfg.h is not
    
r1017 | paaguti
    move CommandArray definition to commands.h
    this will allow to have all acronym related stuff in one isolated file
    
r1016 | paaguti
    trivial ifpdf package support
    
r1015 | paaguti
    Minor bug correction in allocation 
    Allocate labels 8 by 8
    
r1014 | paaguti
    new acronym TeX test file
    
r1013 | paaguti
    acronym should allow to remake the acronym test without
    depending on acronym.rtf
    
r1012 | paaguti
    handy little macro to free strings which were allocated
    
r1011 | paaguti
    GetAcronymFromAux can return NULL! Corrected pointer core dump
    
r1010 | paaguti
    compiler complained about no end of line for funct1.h and
    trivial support for the ifpdf package
    
r1009 | paaguti
    Trivial patch for the tests
    
r1008 | prahl
    include "acronyms.h' not "acronym.h"
    
r1007 | prahl
    Fix misspelling of Auxiliary in function name
    
r1006 | prahl
    eliminate redundant ACRONYM defines between xrefs.c and acronyms.c
rename acronym.c to acronyms.c  so that it is consistent with other
    files in the codebase.
    
r1005 | prahl
    Eliminated unnecessary headers.  Renamed CmdAC -> CmdACNew so that 
    new implementation and old ones can coexist.
    
r1004 | prahl
    refactoring of cfg.c by Pedro Aranda
    file_exists() function added to utils.c
    
r1003 | prahl
    Changes to ignore.cfg by Pedro Aranda
    
r1002 | prahl
    rename aux to auxfile to avoid problems on windows
    
r1001 | prahl
    the great detabbing ... from now on there should be no tabs in
    the source files.  Indents should always be four tabs.
    
r1000 | prahl
    convert // to /*  */
    remove executable bit from acronym.bib
    
r999 | prahl
    New inline utility functions by Pedro Aranda
    
r998 | prahl
    decrease verbosity when entering and leaving environments
    
r997 | prahl
    new inline utilities by Pedro Aranda
    
r996 | prahl
    adding new files to the packaged distribution
    
r995 | prahl
    New files from Pedro Aranda that improve processing of aux files
    and improved support for acronym.sty.  These are not actually used yet.
    
r994 | prahl
    Pedro Aranda's test files for the acronym.sty package
    
r993 | whennings
    fixed some bugs and added two characters to test/ucsymbols.tex
    
r992 | prahl
    remove executable bit on direct.tex
    add direct.tex to list of files translated when 'make char' is used
    add direct.tex to the package
    
r991 | whennings
    fixed a bug and addes STIXGeneral to two more characters in direct.cfg.
    added direct.tex as test file for all characters in direct.cfg
    
r990 | prahl
    fix for harvard citations found by Pedro A Aranda
    
r989 | whennings    
    modifications to make test/babel_* files LaTeX properly
    
r988 | prahl    
    add babel* file to the list to be converted after "make all"
    add encoding tables for 0t2, t2a, t2b.  The later two will probably
    go away and the former is not used yet
    
r987 | whennings    
    modified cfg/direct.cfg so that symbols which are not available 
    under MS Windows get formatted in font STIXGeneral
    Corrected test/ucsymbols.tex
    
r986 | prahl    
    add macintosh central european character encoding
    
r985 | prahl    
    More unicode conversion.  Eliminate all use of Symbol font.
    Directly convert from various character encodings e.g. latin5
    to Unicode.  Delete lots of code that is no longer needed.
    
r984 | prahl    
    start of missing characters for XP
    
r983 | prahl    
    More of the great Unicode migration.  This moves all the
    instances of CmdSymbolChar and CmdMTExtraChar out of commands.c
    Now, these characters can be found in direct.cfg.  Future
    work will remove all instances of CmdSymbolChar and CmdMTExtraChar
    from the rest of the code base.
    
r982 | prahl    
    Fix problem on Fedora.  It turns out that strcpy(p1,p2) is allowed
    undefined behavior if p1 and p2 point to overlapping areas.
    
r981 | whennings    
    modified direct_ucs.cfg to use the Unicode font for special symbols.
    updated documentation (but font usage for special symbols is work in progress)
    updated l2rshell to version number 2.1.0
    
r980 | prahl    
    reduce debugging noise
    
r979 | prahl    
    fix bug related to the new style system.  There is a pretty
    big mismatch between LaTeX and Word styles.  This is probably
    not the right patch because it regresses the way that section
    headings look.  It does fix the bug associated with {\tt \begintabular{ll} a & b
    \end{tabular} }
    
r978 | prahl    
    improve how vcenter interacts with fields
    
r977 | prahl    
    fix \makebox and \framebox so they actually emit something
    fix \char'123 (regression)
    move a whole bunch of MTExtra characters to Unicode because
    MTExtra varies in which characters are present.
    
r976 | prahl    
    all characters in ucsymbol.tex and misc3.tex are converted now
    
r975 | prahl    
    add support for a few more math commands found in misc3.tex
    misc3.rtf should convert pretty cleanly now.
    
r974 | prahl    
    change strlcpy to my_strlcpy
    comment out CmdAcronym
    
r973 | prahl    
    support for \not
    
r972 | prahl    
    working version of halign!
    fixed bug when converting \char92
    
r971 | prahl    
    insert a few instances of uint16_t when bit shifting as
    a defense against 64-bit problems
    
r970 | prahl    
    beginning of support for \halign
    
r969 | prahl    
    address warnings found when compiling for Fedora
