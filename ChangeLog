 Improvements to shell scripts to create files in directory that
	the latex file is in rather than the current working directory.
	
2002-03-07 22:46  prahl

 Bitmap conversion of equations now works.  To use this feature you must
	get one of the scripts tex2png_* working and installed as tex2png.  This
	means that in addition of needing latex installed, you will probably need
	dvips and ImageMagick also installed.  In any case, there still remain bugs
	in how equation numbers are handled as well as inline equation conversion
	activation.
	
2002-03-03 21:30  prahl

 Changes to l2r.html in this checkin and the last are a mistake.
	However latex2rtf passes pretty cleanly through both makeindex
	and through texi2dvi --pdf.  There is still quite a bit of clean-up

	just to make sure that improper latex2rtf parsing still creates a file
	that is readable by Word
	
2001-10-22 21:24  prahl

 Added new option to command line to specify the input encoding.  Use
	latex2rtf -C cp850 text

 Much better support for \begin{array} ... \end{array}
	
2001-10-16 19:50  prahl

 added \Upsilon \varepsilon \varrho \L and \l to direct.cfg
	(only the first has a real translation).  I decided that the epsilon
	in the Symbol font was just like \varepsilon and so now \varepsilon
	maps to the epsilon in the Symbol font and \epsilon -> [epsilon]
	added encoding_tables.h to the Makefile
	moved \hoffset and friends to the preamble commands
	fixed a factor of two bug in getDimension

2001-10-07 18:59  prahl

 Made vspace more robust
	
2001-10-07 14:20  prahl

 Added support for \vspace and \vspace*
	Fixed another bug in implementation of \usepackage{helvetica}
	
2001-10-07 11:29  prahl

2001-10-07 08:10  prahl

 Fixed bug with leading spaces in \documentclass[option1, option2]
	
2001-10-06 22:42  prahl

 Support for different input encodings.  Much more work needed, but
	this provides basic support for all input encodings available for latex2e.
	
2001-09-26 07:02  prahl

 Patch by Chris Lawrence to fix off-by-one error in cfg.c
	This fixes bug when LIBDIR does not end with a '/'
	
2001-09-25 22:34  prahl

 Updated changelog.  Added box.tex as test file.  Updated ToDo
	Updated version.h to 1.9i.  Modified Makefile to not use -Wall
	This is the last check-in before 1.9i tarball is released.
	
2001-09-25 20:31  prahl

 Rewrote paragraph handling completely.  Far fewer bugs in indentation
	of paragraphs.  Support for \indent and \noindent.  Infrastructure
	support to handle \vskip and \vspace.  Added reasonable hanging indent
	for bibliographies.  All test files now have matching opening and
	closing braces in the created RTF files.  Fixed bugs for \chapter.
	Eliminated a handful of global variables.
	
2001-09-18 22:06  prahl

 Fixed brace bug in equations.c
	Fixed tabbing in equations.c
	Fixed alignment of equation numbers

2001-09-17 22:20  prahl

 Fixed bug in IgnoreEnvironment
	Fixed bug in IgnoreParameter
	Added feature! insert \verbositylevel{5} in a LaTeX document and
	dynamically increase the verbosity of debugging output.  Of course
	the 5 can be replaced by any number from 0 to 6
	
2001-09-17 20:40  prahl

 Default alignment is once again justified
	Fixed bug with \mbox{}
	Fixed bug with \footnote{}
	Added support for german language
	Some support for french
	
2001-09-16 09:33  prahl

 Fixed bug in RTF output for papesize.
	Added support for b5paper, a5paper
	Enhanced support for all page sizes
	
2001-09-15 22:11  prahl

 Gave up and completely revised font handling.  latex2rtf now uses an output
	filter to keep track of the brace level and font changes in the RTF file.
	This allows \emph to be handled properly.  This will also allow digits to
	be typeset upright in math mode, but this has not been implemented yet.
	
2001-09-09 22:40  prahl

 Eliminated many mysterious spaces that crept into the RTF file
	Added braces to localize the effects of environments
	There are still problems with identifying the current font when
	environments are closed.   This is probably insoluble give the
	current constraints on the problem.
	Added align.tex to test the center, flushright, and flushleft environments
	
2001-09-09 20:14  prahl

 Fixed \sffamily and others
	Forced \plain in verb environments
	Eliminated extra document environment
	
2001-09-09 12:43  prahl

 added fancy.tex to test simple header commands
	
2001-09-09 12:41  prahl

 Added support for \cfoot \lfoot \rfoot \chead \lhead \rhead
	
2001-09-05 21:43  prahl

 separated convert routines into convert.c
	separated bibliographic routines into biblio.c
	separated tabular and tabbing routines into tables.c
	eliminated funct2 by merging routines with funct1
	moved ignore routines to ignore.c
	Improved support for \emph and \em
	Problems still remain with test files misc3 and misc4
	
2001-08-23 07:26  prahl

 Just cleaning up the header for funct2.c.
	
2001-08-22 22:35  prahl

 Yet more changes to font handling.  Added \upshape \textup and \begin{upshape}
	Added \begin{Verbatim} as well as \Frac.  Tried to add \prod and \sum,
	but these don't yet work.  Seems that there are problems with processing
	frac.tex.  These will be worked on.
	
2001-08-21 22:50  prahl

 More improvements in handling of font family, shape, series, and size.
	LaTeX2RTF infrastructure now mimicks the LaTeX view of fonts.  This
	check-in fixes problems with fonts.tex and fontsize.tex.  It also adds
	support for \em, \emph, and \begin{em}...\end{em}.  Support for the
	relatively unusual \begin{itshape}...\end{itshape} and others is also
	included.
	
	Problems remain with misc3.tex and misc4.tex
	
2001-08-19 18:12  prahl

 Fixed subtle bug in ConvertString().  This was the real cause of the last
	problem with fonts.tex.  Basically, ConvertString() called Convert() only
	once, however if the string contained any open/close brace pairs e.g.,
	'the {\it italic} string' then everything after the closing brace would
	be discarded.
	
	I also fixed a problem with discarding the first space sent to Convert().
	
	The fix to ConvertString() and the initial space conversion require some
	careful testing.
	
2001-08-19 17:02  prahl

 Fixed problem with processing fonts.tex
	Added support for a variety French abbreviations
	
2001-08-12 16:39  prahl

	        Clearly separate preamble from the document in hopes that
	          one day more appropriate values for page size, margins,
	          paragraph spacing etc, will be used in the RTF header
	        I have added initial support for page sizes still needs testing
	        added two more test files misc3.tex and misc4.tex

 1.9e
	        Revised all the accented character code using ideas borrowed from ltx2rtf.
	        Comparing ltx2rtf and latex2rtf indicates that Taupin and Lehner tended to work on
	        different areas of the latex->rtf conversion process.  Adding
	        accented characters is the first step in the merging process.
	
	        Added MacRoman font handling (primarily to get the breve accent)
	        Now supports a wide variety of accented characters.
	        (compound characters only work under more recent versions of word)
	        Reworked the code to change font sizes.
	        Added latex logo code from ltx2rtf
	        Extracted character code into separate file chars.c
	        Fixed bug with \sf reverting to roman
	        Added two new testing files fontsize.tex and accentchars.tex
	
2001-08-12 11:53  prahl

	        Rewrote the \cite code.
	        No crashes when .aux missing.
	        Inserts '?' for unknown citations
	        Added cite.tex and cite.bib to for testing \cite commands
	        hyperref not tested since I don't use it.
	        A small hyperref test file would be nice
	        Revised treatment of \oe and \OE per Wilfried Hennings suggestions
	        Added support for MT Extra in direct.cfg and fonts.cfg so that
	        more math characters will be translated e.g., \ell (see oddchars.tex)
	        added and improved font changing commands e.g., \texttt, \it
	
2001-08-12 11:41  prahl
