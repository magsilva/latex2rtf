1 Introduction
**************

LaTeX2RTF is a translator program from LaTeX text into "rich text
format" files.  These files are commonly referred to as RTF files.  RTF
is a published standard format by Microsoft.  This standard can be
ambiguous in places and Microsoft ignores parts of the standard it finds
inconvenient, but RTF is widely used by many WYSIWIG text editors and is
supported by Microsoft Word and most text processors.

   LaTeX2RTF translates the text and as much of the formatting
information from LaTeX to RTF. Be forewarned that the typeset output is
not nearly as good as what you would get from using LaTeX directly.  So,
why bother translating?  Consider,

  1. You use LaTeX and hate everything beginning with MS-...
     Nevertheless, you have to share your documents with people who
     don't even know that there are alternatives to MS-...

  2. You know somebody who frequently sends you very fine LaTeX
     documents.  Unfortunately, you are "on the other side" and need to
     import her files, steal some part, and then desktop publish it in
     your fine MS-... environment.

  3. You like LaTeX and BibTeX. You interact with the rest of the world.
     You know someone that wants to include your writing in a Word
     document.

   There are drawbacks to the conversion process.  In fact, don't expect
any LaTeX file to be converted as you would like, don't expect it to be
converted without errors or warnings, and don't be especially surprised
when it doesn't convert at all.  LaTeX2RTF is known to have many bugs
and many missing features.  Paradoxically, this number seems to grow
more and more with each day.  However, we can categorically state that
there are some special cases in which a LaTeX file will be translated to
RTF satisfactorily by LaTeX2RTF--This was sort of disclaimer, ok?  OK!

   LaTeX is a system for typesetting text and therefore it focuses on
the logical structure of a document, whilst RTF is meant to be a
transport format for a family of Desktop Publishing Software, dealing
mostly with the design of a text.

   Although the commands and styles in LaTeX are much more flexible and
standardized than in RTF, only a small subset of commands has been
implemented to date (*note Unimplemented Features::).

   Some of the capabilities of LaTeX2RTF are restricted in scope or
buggy (*note Known Bugs::).

   RTF is a moving target, because Microsoft does not stop inventing new
extensions and features; consequently you cannot view newer RTF files
with older word processors.  The syntax and semantics of RTF are
somewhat artistic, i.e., you can generate a syntactically correct RTF
file that cannot be displayed by some/most word processors.  For more
details on RTF the specification consult the links at
<http://latex2rtf.sf.net/>

2.1 General
===========

The documentation of the program is found in the 'doc/' directory in the
file 'latex2rtf.texi' in the GNU TeXInfo format.  For your convenience,
you can find HTML and PDF versions of the manual there as well.
Note: In this manual, the terms "directory" and "folder" are used
interchangeably.

2.2 Obtaining LaTeX2RTF
=======================

LaTeX2RTF is available for many Unix Platforms, for the Macintosh, and
for MS-DOS, including all versions of MS Windows.

   The latest version of LaTeX2RTF is available at SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/) and -- with some delay --
on CTAN sites: e.g., <http://www.dante.de> or <http://www.ctan.org>.

   The DOS package will also run under all MS Windows versions up to
Windows 7, except 64bit systems.  It requires an i386 processor or
better.
It should only be used on older Microsoft systems.
For Win9x, ME, NT, or newer, you should use the win or win-NO-GUI
package.

   The win-NO-GUI package only runs under Win32 (Win9x, ME, NT, 2000,
XP, 2003, Vista, Win7).  From LaTeX2RTF version 2.0.0 up it also runs on
64bit systems.

   The win package is the win-NO-GUI package plus graphical user
interface (GUI) shell (l2rshell) and installer.
It only runs under Win NT, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, and Win7.
From LaTeX2RTF version 2.0.0 up it also runs on 64bit systems.

   The win64 package (only LaTeX2RTF version 1.9.19) is the win package
but with 32bit versions of the shell utilities so that it also runs on
64bit systems.  From LaTeX2RTF version 2.0.0 up, there is no separate
win64 package, as the win32 package also runs on 64bit systems.

   There are a few people working on LaTeX2RTF, and some more make
contributions, coordinated by Wilfried Hennings (texconvfaq "at"
gmx.de).  See the SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/) project pages for the
latest news.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: UNIX,  Next: DOS or Windows,  Prev: Obtaining LaTeX2RTF,  Up: Installation

2.3 UNIX
========

To install,
  1. Edit 'Makefile' for your local configuration.  In particular, pay
     attention to the 'PREFIX' variable.  If you do not have root access
     you might wish to set the makefile variable 'PREFIX' to be your
     home directory.

     On some machines the cc compiler will issue errors.  Therefore the
     default compiler command in the Makefile is 'CC=gcc'.

  2. From version 1.9.13 up, LaTeX2RTF supports conversion of LaTeX
     equations to bitmaps using the shell script 'latex2png', found in
     'scripts/'.  'latex2png' requires that LaTeX, 'Ghostscript' and
     'ImageMagick' are installed.  LaTeX2RTF will translate documents
     without a working 'latex2png', but some features will be missing.
     You can verify that the 'latex2png' script is working by typing
     'make' in the 'scripts/' directory.

  3. 'make'

     If this is not your first time installation, you may want to
     preserve your old configuration ('*.cfg') files.  Copy them to a
     safe place before installing.

     On IBM AIX, the IBM make utility does not support some of the
     commands used in Makefile.  In this case use 'gmake' (from GNU)
     instead.

     Sun has decided to support the XPG4 standard on Solaris by an
     alternative set of binaries.  To allow bitmap conversion of
     equations, two things are needed.  First, change the first line of
     latex2png to '#!/usr/xpg4/bin/sh' Second, define the XPG4_GREP
     environment variable accordingly, for bash-like shells
     'XPG4_GREP=/usr/xpg4/bin/grep; export XPG4_GREP' or for tsch-like
     shells 'setenv XPG4_GREP /usr/xpg4/bin/grep'.

  4. 'make install'

     If your 'mkdir' doesn't support the '-p' option, then create the
     necessary directories by hand and remove the option from the
     '$MKDIR' variable.  If you have other problems, just copy
     'latex2rtf' and 'latex2png' to a binary directory, and move the
     contents of the 'cfg/' directory to the location specified by
     '$CFG_INSTALL'.

  5. 'make check'

     [OPTIONAL] This tests LaTeX2RTF on a variety of LaTeX files.
     Expect a whole lot of warnings, but no outright errors.  (On IBM
     AIX, use 'gmake check'.)  Note that this will check the basic
     functionality of the 'latex2png' script, and then that of
     'latex2rtf'.

  6. 'make install-info'

     [OPTIONAL] This installs '.info' files for use with the 'info'
     program.

   You no longer need to define the environment variable 'RTFPATH'.
This is only necessary if you move the directory containing the '.cfg'
files.  Just define 'RTFPATH' to be the path for the new location of the
'cfg' directory.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: DOS or Windows,  Next: MS Windows systems,  Prev: UNIX,  Up: Installation

2.4 plain DOS
=============

The UNIX and Mac packages do not contain an executable for DOS or
Windows.  You may compile it yourself (with djgpp or MinGW) or get the
DOS package as file 'latex2rtf-x.x.x_dos.zip' (where x.x.x is the
version number)
or the win-NO-GUI package as file 'latex2rtf-x.x.x_win-NO-GUI.zip' (no
installer, no graphical user interface (GUI))
from SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/)

   The DOS package contains a precompiled executable which should run
under plain DOS and also in the command prompt (or "console") of any MS
Windows system including Vista and Windows 7 but not on 64bit systems.

   To install the DOS or win-no-GUI package of LaTeX2RTF, extract all
files from the zip archive, preserving the folder structure (winzip:
check "use folder names"), preferably to 'C:\l2r', or under Windows, to
your "Program Files" folder (which ever it is named in your system)
because then it will find its cfg files by default.
If you extracted them to another folder (e.g. 'C:\my_files\l2r'), either
edit the file 'L2RPREP.BAT' and change the folder 'C:\l2r' to where you
put them, or specify the path to the cfg folder in the command line.
Avoid blanks in folder and file names!

   Make sure that the folder containing the file 'L2RPREP.BAT' is in
your search path, or put this file into a folder which is in your search
path.
To display the current search path, enter 'PATH' from the command prompt
(with no arguments).

   Under plain DOS, conversion of equations or figures to bitmaps is not
possible because Ghostscript and ImageMagick are not available for plain
DOS.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: MS Windows systems,  Next: Macintosh,  Prev: DOS or Windows,  Up: Installation

2.5 MS Windows systems
======================

To install LaTeX2RTF on a MS Windows system (WinNT, Win2000, WinXP,
Vista, Win7), download the win package, execute the
'latex2rtf-x.x.x_win.exe' (where x.x.x is the version number) and follow
the instructions.

   Note: The installer and GUI shell do not support Win9x and WinMe
since LaTeX2RTF v.1.9.17.  If you have one of these systems, you should
use the win-NO-GUI package (1.9.19 and up) of LaTeX2RTF.

   To start the program double-click the LaTeX2RTF icon, or drag and
drop a '.tex' file onto the icon.

   If your LaTeX document refers to external graphic files, e.g. eps, or
you want to use the option to convert equations to bitmaps, you must
have LaTeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript installed.  These programs are
freely available for download at <http://www.miktex.org/>,
<http://www.imagemagick.org> and <http://www.ghostscript.com>

   The following versions were available at the time of writing and
tested with LaTeX2RTF version 2.3.11:
- MikTeX 2.9
- Ghostscript 9.19
- ImageMagick-7.0.1-8-Q16-x86-dll.exe

   When installing ImageMagick, be sure to choose (check)
"Install legacy utilities (e.g.  convert)"

   If MikTeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed, the paths to
their executables are detected automatically.  If for any reason this
doesn't happen, these paths can be specified manually in the
"Environment" tab of the LaTeX2RTF GUI shell window.

   If you need to start LaTeX2RTF not from its own shell but from
commandline or another Windows application, you need to add the folder
containing the latex2png script and the helper programs to the search
path.
Some applications (e.g. Lyx) allow to temporarily add the path by
specifying it in the options.
If this is not possible, you can add the latex2rtf folder to Windows'
default path like follows:

   To add a folder - e.g. C:\Program Files\latex2rtf - to the search
path:
   * Note that the folder name "Program Files" contains a blank.  This
     would lead to some problems as some parts of the latex2rtf program
     package interpret the blank as a parameter delimiter.  Therefore in
     the following example the folder name "Program Files" is replaced
     by its DOS equivalent "PROGRA~1" which has the additional effect
     that this is similar for several if not all European languages.
   * Win95, Win98, WinME
        * Open the file 'C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT' either with Edit (DOS) or with
          Notepad (Windows).
        * At the end of that file, add the line
          'PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\latex2rtf;%PATH%'
        * Save the file to its original location.  Shutdown and reboot
          the PC.
   * WinNT, Win2000, WinXP, Vista, Win7
        * Right-click "My Computer" (German: "Arbeitsplatz"), then
          select "Properties";
        * NT: Click the "Environment" tab;
          XP and up: Click the "Advanced" tab, then the "Environment
          variables" button;
        * Find the line beginning with 'PATH=' and insert the string
          'C:\PROGRA~1\latex2rtf;'
          so that the complete line looks like
          'PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\latex2rtf;C:\WINDOWS;...'
        * Click "OK"

   If you do NOT use the GUI (l2rshell.exe), either the folders where
TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed must also be in your
search path, or you must edit the file 'L2RPREP.BAT', ensure that the
pathes in this file point to the folders where TeX, ImageMagick and
Ghostscript are installed on your machine, and call 'l2rprep' before
calling 'latex2rt'.
Or you edit 'l2r.bat' and call 'l2r' instead of calling 'latex2rt'.

   If you DO use the GUI (l2rshell.exe), the TeX, ImageMagick and
Ghostscript folders are automatically added to the search path by the
GUI.

   When equations are to be converted to bitmaps, for each equation
LaTeX2RTF first writes a temporary l2r_nnnn.tex file to disk which
consists of only the equation to be converted.  It then sends the call
for '"bash latex2png l2r_nnnn.tex"' to the operating system.
In previous versions of latex2rtf, some users got the message "Out of
environment space" (can occur only under Windows 95, Windows 98 or
Windows ME); this should be solved now by using bash.exe instead of
command.com.

2.6 Macintosh
=============

If you want a MacOS X version, make sure that you have installed the
developer tools CD that is appropriate for your OS version, and then
follow the directions above for a UNIX installation.  Alternatively you
can install using fink <http://www.finkproject.org/> and
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/>.

   As of 2006-01-30 there was a GUI shell for Macintosh at
<http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/fischerk/LaTeX2rtf/index.html>
but now (Nov.  2013) this is not available anymore.

   There is a PPC port of an old version 1.9k for Classic MacOS
LaTeX2RTF. To convert a LaTeX file using this version, drag the file
onto the LaTeX2RTF icon.  The translation is best if there are '.aux'
and '.bbl' files in the same folder as the '.tex' file to be converted.
These should be generated using LaTeX and 'bibtex'.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Problems Compiling,  Next: Problems with make check,  Prev: Macintosh,  Up: Installation

2.7 Problems Compiling
======================

The code for LaTeX2RTF is standard ANSI C. Some possible pitfalls are
   * Not correctly defining your compiler in the Makefile.  The default
     is to use 'gcc'.

   * Encountering errors because the compiler options.  During
     development all compiler warnings are turned on.  However,
     different compilers have different interpretations of '-Wall' and
     may generate errors that were not found in a different development
     system.  Please report these, but a quick fix is to remove all
     compiler options.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Problems with make check,  Prev: Problems Compiling,  Up: Installation

2.8 Problems with 'make check'
==============================

All the files in the 'test' directory are converted (with varying
degrees of success) using LaTeX2RTF and are tested before most CVS
check-ins and with all released tarballs.  There will be many warning
messages, but there should be no actual error messages.  If you do not
have a working latex2png script, then some of the files will fail to be
translated.

* Debugging::


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: General Assumptions,  Next: LaTeX2RTF Options,  Prev: Using LaTeX2RTF,  Up: Using LaTeX2RTF

3.1 General Assumptions
=======================

LaTeX2RTF assumes that the '.tex' file you want to convert is a valid
LaTeX document.  The chances of a successful LaTeX2RTF conversion are
slightly better than the proverbial snowball's if the '.tex' file
doesn't 'latex' properly.  Use LaTeX to find and correct errors before
using LaTeX2RTF.
LaTeX2RTF also needs the '.aux' file and '.bbl' file which are generated
by running 'latex' on the '.tex' file

   To correctly convert font names you must edit the 'fonts.cfg'
configuration file.  This file is used to specify the needed font names
and how the LaTeX default font names should be converted to RTF (*note
Font Configuration::).  LaTeX variables and user defined commands are
not evaluated.  They will be simply ignored.  To let LaTeX2RTF know the
names of variables you can add them in the 'ignore.cfg' file (*note
Ignore Command::).

   The environment variable RTFPATH may contain a search path for the
support files (all files ending in '.cfg').  If no file is found during
the search in the search-path or if the environment variable is not set,
the compiled-in default for the configuration-file directory is used.
If the files are not found at all the program aborts.

   In the DOS and Windows versions the search path is separated by ';'
in the Unix version by ':'.  For the paths themselves apply '\' and '/'.
A separator may appear at the beginning or ending of RTFPATH.

   Make sure that the configuration files are in the correct directory
(or folder).  LaTeX2RTF will need at least 'fonts.cfg', 'direct.cfg',
'ignore.cfg', 'english.cfg'.  You may have to change one ore more of
them to suit your needs (*note Configuration::).

   *Note Missing options::, for actual implementations irregularities.

   *Note Reporting Bugs::, for information on how to reach the
maintainer.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: LaTeX2RTF Options,  Next: Debugging,  Prev: General Assumptions,  Up: Using LaTeX2RTF

3.2 LaTeX2RTF Options
=====================

The LaTeX2RTF command converts a LaTeX file into RTF text format.  The
text and much of the formatting information is translated to RTF making
the new file look similar to the original.  The command line syntax is:

     latex2rtf [-options] inputfile[.tex]

   for the DOS and Windows versions:

     latex2rt [-options] inputfile[.tex]

   The options set in the Windows GUI (l2rshell.exe) are inserted as
command line options when clicking RUN.

   The '-options' may consist of one or more of the following

'-a auxfile'
     specify an '.aux' file (for table and figure references) that
     differs from 'inputfile.aux'.  If this is omitted, the name of the
     inputfile with the suffix replaced '.aux''will be taken.  You must
     provide both files ('.tex' and the '.aux') to be able to convert
     cross-references in a LaTeX file.  The '.aux' is created by running
     the 'inputfile.tex' through 'latex'.

'-b bblfile'
     Unless an 'bblfile' is specified with the '-b' option, LaTeX2RTF
     uses a 'inputfile.bbl'.  The 'bblfile' file is used for citations
     and is typically created by running 'inputfile.aux' through
     'bibtex'.

'-C codepage'
     used to specify the character set (code page) used in the LaTeX
     document.  This is only important when non-ansi characters are
     included in the LaTeX document.  Typically this is done in a
     LaTeX2e file by using '\usepackage[codepage]{inputenc}' and in this
     case you need not specify the -C codepage option.  If NO
     '\usepackage[codepage]{inputenc}' is in the LaTeX2e file, you must
     inform the converter about the codepage by the -C codepage option.
     You may select any of the following code pages: ansinew, applemac,
     cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865, decmulti, cp1250, cp1252,
     latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9, next.  The default
     behavior is to use ansinew (code page 1252).  Cyrillic support
     includes conversion of koi8-r, koi8-u, cp1251, cp855, cp866,
     maccyr, and macukr encodings.

'-d debug_level'
     The '-d' option determines the amount of debugging information to
     send to stderr while translating.  debug_level=0 means only Errors,
     '1' Warning Messages (default) also.  The debug_level can go as
     high as '7' for insane amounts of debugging fun.  Warnings and
     error messages are output to stderr and by default listed in the
     console window.  They can be redirected to a file "latex2rtf.log"
     by appending '2>latex2rtf.log' to the command line.

'-D dots_per_inch'
     used to specify the number of dots per inch for equations converted
     to bitmaps.  This value is also used when picture environments are
     converted to bitmaps as well as when EPS graphics are converted to
     png files.  The default value is 300 dots per inch.

'-E#'
     selects whether figures are included in the rtf (default) or
     created as external files with the filenames inserted in the rtf
     text.

     The options -E4, -E8 and -E12 are experimental and may not work as
     expected.

     '-E0'
          Do not include any figures in RTF.
     '-E1'
          Include figures that need no conversion.
     '-E2'
          Include figures that need conversion.
     '-E3'
          Include all figures (default).
     '-E4'
          Insert filenames for figures that do not need conversion.
     '-E8'
          Insert filenames for figures that need conversion.
     '-E12'
          Insert filenames for all figures.
     With options -E8 and -E12, pdf and ps graphics as well as tikz
     graphics are converted to eps and the eps filenames inserted in the
     document text.  With -E4 and -E12, bitmap files are inserted in
     their original format.  After opening the rtf in a textprocessing
     or dtp program, a macro can search for the inserted filenames and
     insert the files in their places.  Further info is in the
     description of the -M option.

'-f#'
     where # selects which fields to use during conversion:
     '-f0'
          do not use fields in RTF. This is handy when primitive RTF
          editors are being used to view the RTF output.
     '-f1'
          use fields for equations but not '\ref' and '\cite'.
     '-f2'
          use fields for '\ref' and '\cite' but not equations.  This
          will be useful for versions of OpenOffice that import
          cross-references properly (as of Sept 2003 in a soon-to-be
          released version) but do not properly handle fields in
          equations.
     '-f3'
          use fields when possible.  This is the default and is most
          useful when the RTF file is being exported to be used in Word.
          This retains the most information from the original LaTeX
          file.

'-F'
     use LaTeX to create bitmaps for all figures.  This may help when
     figures are not translated properly with the default settings.
     This typically requires a functional version of ImageMagick on your
     machine to work properly.

'-h'
     a short usage description

'-i language'
     used to set the idiom or language used by the LaTeX document.
     Typically, this is specified in a LaTeX2e document by including
     '\usepackage[language]{babel}' where 'language' is one of the
     languages supported by the 'babel' package.  All languages listed
     in the babel system are supported so far as translations for
     "Chapter," "References," and the like.  Furthermore, some commands
     found in the style files for german, french, russian, and czech
     style are supported (*note Language Configuration::).

'-l'
     same as '-i latin1' (Note that the default behavior is to use
     'ansinew' which is a superset of 'latin1').  Included for backwards
     compatibility.

'-M#'
     where # selects the type of equation conversion.  Use
     '-M1'
          convert displayed equations to RTF
     '-M2'
          convert inline equations to RTF
     '-M4'
          convert displayed equations to bitmap
     '-M8'
          convert inline equations to bitmap
     '-M16'
          insert Word comment field that contains the raw LaTeX equation
     '-M32'
          insert the raw latex equation in the RTF text delimited by '$
          ... $' for inline equations and by '\[ ... \]' for displayed
          equations.
          This is useful when using version 6 of the MathType equation
          editor, which converts typed or pasted TeX code into a
          MathType equation.
          Probably this could also be useful for use in OpenOffice, as
          OO has an equation syntax which partially resembles TeX
          syntax.
     '-M64'
          convert displayed equations to EPS files and insert filenames
          in RTF text.
     '-M128'
          convert inline equations to EPS files and insert filenames in
          RTF text.
     These switches can be combined to get different effects.  Handy
     examples are
     '-M3'
          convert both inline and displayed equations to RTF (default)
     '-M6'
          convert inline equations to RTF and displayed equations to
          bitmaps
     '-M12'
          convert both inline and displayed equations to bitmaps
     '-M192'
          convert both inline and displayed equations to EPS and insert
          filenames in RTF text
     Conversion to bitmaps or eps requires that you have installed a
     working latex2png script.  Producing bitmaps is slow.
     When running the DOS version, conversion to bitmaps works for the
     first 26 equations but fails for the rest with the message
     "latex2png: pipe error: Too many open files (EMFILE)".
     This is probably a bug in the djgpp 2.04 compiler.
     The Windows version, compiled with MinGW, successfully converts at
     least 500 equations to bitmaps.
     When -M64, -M128 or both are specified, equations are converted to
     individual eps files, the filenames of which are literally inserted
     in the rtf file, delimited by [###...###].  After loading the rtf
     file in a text processing program, a macro can be run which
     searches for "[###" and "###]", extracts the filename, and inserts
     the eps in that place.  The Windows installer package contains the
     code of such a macro for Word2010 in the file
     "WordMacro_InsertEPSfromNames.txt" in subfolder "scripts".  (This
     macro may also run on other versions of Word but it was only tested
     on Word2010.)  In Word, the inserted eps graphics display in bad
     quality on the screen and on non-postscript printers but can be
     printed in high quality on postscript and pdf printers.

'-o outputfile'
     Unless an 'outputfile' is specified with the '-o' option, the
     resulting RTF filename is formed by removing '.tex' from the
     'inputfile' and appending '.rtf'.

'-p'
     Escape parentheses in mathematical formulas.  This has no effect
     unless EQ fields are being generated.  When this option is used,
     then a '(' or ')' that appears in an EQ field will be preceeded by
     a backslash.  Despite documentation to the contrary (which says
     that all parentheses should be escaped), adding escapes usually
     produces a worse result than doing nothing.  If Word displays some
     formulas with parentheses as "Error!", you might try this option as
     a last resort.  See also the -S option.

     This is an option because it will break typesetting equations with
     non-matching parentheses (because an unmatched unquoted parenthesis
     would terminate the field).

'-P /path/to/cfg'
     used to specify the folder (i.e.  directory) that contains the
     '.cfg' files and/or the folder that contains the latex2png script.
     Unix, Mac: The folder that contains the latex2png script must be
     prepended by a ":".
     DOS, Windows: The scripts folder is not used, the scripts are
     always taken from the search path, therefore the folder containing
     the scripts and the helper programs must be the first in the search
     path.  You can either add it to the search path permanently or add
     it temporarily by calling l2rprep.bat before starting conversions.
     If any of the folder names contains a blank, the folder string must
     be enclosed in single (Unix, Mac) or double (DOS, Windows) quotes.
     Examples:
     (Unix:) 'latex2rtf -P ./cfg/:./scripts/ foo'
     (DOS/Windows:) 'latex2rt -P "C:\Program Files\latex2rtf\cfg" foo'
     Note that without specifying the -P option, LaTeX2RTF tries to find
     its cfg files in the following locations:
     1.  the folder specified by the environment variable 'RTFPATH', if
     this variable exists;
     2.  The folder '%PROGRAMFILES%\latex2rtf\cfg', if the variable
     'PROGRAMFILES' exists - this is the folder in which LaTeX2RTF is
     installed by the Windows GUI installer with default settings;
     3.  the folder specified at compilation time by the variable
     'CFGDIR'.  This is set in the Makefile.  The DOS version is
     compiled with 'CFGDIR=C:/l2r', the Windows version with
     'CFGDIR=C:/PROGRA~1/latex2rtf'.

'-se#'
     selects the scale for equation conversion, where # is the scale
     factor (default 1.00).

'-sf#'
     selects the scale for figure conversion, where # is the scale
     factor (default 1.00).

'-t#'
     where # selects the type of table conversion.  Use
     '-t1'
          convert tables to RTF (default)
     '-t2'
          convert tables to bitmaps

'-v or -V'
     prints version information on standard output and exits.

'-S'
     used to specify that semicolons should be used to separate
     arguments in RTF fields (instead of commas).  Typically this is
     needed when the machine that opens the RTF file has a version of
     Windows that uses ',' for decimal points.

'-T /path/to/tmp'
     used to specify the folder where to put temporary files.  The path
     can be absolute, e.g. '/path/to/tmp' or relative to the folder
     where the .tex input file is in, e.g. 'tmp' or './tmp'.
     If you call LaTeX2RTF from the commandline (e.g. under Linux or
     when called as export filter by LyX), make sure that the tmp folder
     exists.  Only the LaTeX2RTF Windows shell tries to create the tmp
     folder, the command line program doesn't.

'-W'
     includes warnings directly in the RTF file

'-Z#'
     add the specified number of extra '}' to the end of the RTF file.
     This is useful for files that are not cleanly converted by
     LaTeX2RTF.

   With no arguments other than switches starting with a "-", LaTeX2RTF
acts as a filter, i.e., it reads from 'stdin' and writes to 'stdout'.
In addition, diagnostic messages are sent to 'stderr'.  If these
standard channels are not redirected using '<' and '>', then the input
is read from the command line, and both output and error messages are
printed on the screen.  To redirect warnings and error messages to a
file "latex2rtf.log", append '2>latex2rtf.log' to the command line.

   If a non-switch argument is present, LaTeX2RTF assumes it is the name
of the input file.  The file must have extension ".tex" but the
extension is optional.  The output file is constructed from the input
file name by removing the extension ".tex" and adding ".rtf".

3.3 Debugging
=============

With the '-d' option you can specify how much processing information
LaTeX2RTF reports.  If there is a logfile specified the output goes to
this file.  Nonetheless Warnings and Errors are logged to stderr always.
They can be redirected to a file "latex2rtf.log" by appending
'2>latex2rtf.log' to the command line.

   Possible values of '-d' are
  0. only errors.
  1. Translation Warnings (default).
  2. shows preparsing of sections
  3. Reasonably high level debugging messages
  4. Show all function calls
  5. Show each character as it is processed
  6. Show processing of characters as they are output as well

4.1 LaTeX2e
===========

LaTeX2RTF understands most of the commands introduced with LaTeX2e.  It
translates both the old 2.09 version of
'\documentstyle[options]{format#}' and the newer
'\documentclass[options]{format}'.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Unicode Support,  Next: Input Encoding,  Prev: LaTeX2e,  Up: Features

4.2 Unicode Support
===================

As of version 1.9.17 and up, LaTeX2RTF has limited unicode support.
LaTeX files that use unicode sequences are just emitted directly into
the RTF file.
Symbols and odd characters in math sequences may also be converted to a
unicode sequence.  Some of them need the STIXGeneral fonts (see *note
Math and Special Symbols::) to be installed on the system where the rtf
file is to be displayed or printed.

   Support for unicode encoded input is activated by the LaTeX command
'\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}'
or
'\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}'.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Input Encoding,  Next: Language Support,  Prev: Unicode Support,  Up: Features

4.3 Input Encoding
==================

It is not necesary to specify the '-C' option if you use
'\usepackage{isolatin1}' or '\documentstyle[isolatin1]{...}'.  LaTeX2RTF
automagically detects these packages/style options and switches to
processing of ISO-Latin1 codes.  The following encodings are supported:
ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865, decmulti,
cp1250, cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9, next,
koi8-r, koi8-u, cp1251, cp855, cp866, maccyr, macukr, utf8, and utf8x.
The encoding used in RTF files is cp1252.  If cyrillic fonts are
present, then these are represented in the RTF file using cp1251
(Windows Cyrillic).


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Language Support,  Next: Cross References,  Prev: Input Encoding,  Up: Features

4.4 Language Support
====================

The following languages from the Babel package are supported: afrikaans,
german, nynorsk, spanish, bahasa, dutch, icelandic, polish, swedish,
basque, english, portuges, turkish, brazil, esperanto, irish, romanian,
usorbian, breton, estonian, italian, samin, welsh, catalan, finnish,
latin, scottish, croatian, lsorbian, serbian, czech, french, magyar,
slovak, danish, galician, norsk, slovene.

   The only thing that these files do is to translate various words
usually emitted by LaTeX during processing.  For example, this ensures
that the LaTeX2RTF will provide the correct translation of the word
"Chapter" in the converted document.

   You can select any of the above languages using the '-l' option.
This is not needed if your LaTeX file contains
'\usepackage[language]{babel}'.

   Encountering the 'german' package or babel option (by H. Partl of the
Vienna University) makes LaTeX2RTF behave like that: German Quotes,
German Umlauts by '"a', etc...  This support is programmed directly into
LaTeX2RTF and supporting similar features for other languages will
require patching the source code.

   There is similar support for 'french' packages.

   There is reasonable support for english, latin1, latin2, and cyrillic
languages.

   *Note Language Configuration::, for details on how to write a
'language.cfg' file for your language by yourself.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Cross References,  Next: Page Formatting,  Prev: Language Support,  Up: Features

4.5 Cross References
====================

Cross references include everything that you might expect and then some:
bibliographic citations, equation references, table references, figure
references, and section references.  Section, equation, table and figure
references are implemented by placing RTF bookmarks around the equation
number (or table number or figure number).

   Page references work but are implemented as "warm" cross-references.
This means that Word does not automatically update the page references
when the file is opened.  To update the page references you must select
the entire document (in Word) and press 'F9'.

   Bibliographic references currently require that a valid '.aux' file
be present.  This is where LaTeX2RTF obtains the reference numbers.  It
would be nice if LaTeX2RTF just automatically numbered the references
when there was no '.aux' file, but LaTeX2RTF does not do this yet.

   LaTeX2RTF relies on BibTeX to convert and format bibliographic
entries.  Usually the style file for a particular BibTeX format does not
use any special LaTeX commands and therefore the bibliography file
'file.bbl' can be processed by LaTeX2RTF without difficulty.  As a
consequence, LaTeX2RTF can handle most bibliography styles without
problem.

   There are several latex style packages that add additional latex
commands to enhance bibliographic formatting.  LaTeX2RTF currently
supports the following bibliographic packages:
apacite, apalike, authordate, harvard, natbib (also with apanat1b).
These packages have many, many options and you may encounter problems
with formatting in special cases.

   As of LaTeX2RTF 1.9.17 and up, the natbib command bibpunct is
supported.

   Footnotes are implemented and appear at the bottom of each page.

   Indexing is reasonably-well supported.  The simple mark-up of
'makeindex'
     \index{topic!subtopic@\textit{subtopic}}
   is supported.  The rest of the fancy indexing stuff is not
implemented.  The index is created at the location of the '\printindex'
command.  When a file with an index is first opened in Word, you must
select the entire file and update the page references and fields by
pressing 'F9'.

   Currently, there is no support for '\labels' of '\item's in enumerate
environments.

   The conversion of cross-references is not perfect because of the
different mechanisms in the LaTeX and Word worlds.  In particular, if
there are multiple '\label' in a figure, table, or section environment
then only the first gets processed.  It is also possible to confuse the
LaTeX2RTF in eqnarray environments.

4.6 Page Formatting
===================

LaTeX2RTF will handle some basic page formatting options, including
\doublespacing (as implemented in the setspace package), and the margin
setting options provided by the geometry package including commands in
the ratio, centering and margin families.  Not all geometry options are
implemented yet, in part because there are no corresponding rtf commands
for many of them.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Equations,  Next: Math and Special Symbols,  Prev: Page Formatting,  Up: Features

4.7 Equations
=============

There are six separate levels of equation translation based on the -M
switch, see *note LaTeX2RTF Options::.  Each equation is converted
either to an EQ field or to a bitmap or inserted as raw TeX code in the
document or converted to an eps file with the eps file name inserted in
the document text delimited by [###...###].

   This is an interim solution (for some definition of "interim").
Ideally the equations would become OLE equation objects in the RTF file,
but this needs to be implemented.

   Some functions in the EQ fields have two or more parameters with a
separator between each two.  Unfortunately, the interpretation of these
separators depends on the country specific settings in the MS Windows
system in which the rtf file is opened.  e.g. in English versions of MS
Windows, the default parameter separator is the comma, in German
versions the default is the semicolon.  If the parameter in the RTF file
does not match the Windows setting, some EQ fields are not interpreted
correctly.  You can check and set the separator in [Windows control
panel - country settings - numbers - list separator].  By default,
LaTeX2RTF uses the comma as separator.  If LaTeX2RTF is called with the
command line parameter -S , the semicolon is inserted as parameter
delimiter.

   Theoretically, according to the Word help file, parentheses '(' or
')' in mathematical formulas should be escaped (by a preceding
backslash).  Despite this, adding escapes usually produces a worse
result than doing nothing.  If Word displays some formulas with
parentheses as "Error!", you might try the -p option as a last resort.

   It is also possible to convert an EQ field generated by LaTeX2RTF to
an Equation Editor object by opening the rtf file in Word and
double-clicking on the equation.  However there are bugs in the
interface between Word and Equation Editor which prevent symbols in font
Symbol or MTExtra to be converted correctly.  The full commercial
version of the Equation Editor, called MathType, handles this conversion
correctly.

   If you have MathType version 6 or later, an even better way to
convert LaTeX equations to MathType is letting LaTeX2RTF write the LaTeX
code of the equations verbatim in the rtf file (option -M32), then open
the rtf file in Word, select the LaTeX code of an equation, cut it to
the clipboard, open MathType, and paste the code.  MathType will convert
the code into an equation.  Wilfried tried to automate this in a Word
macro, but this fails because the macro does not wait until MathType is
started and ready to receive the pasted code.  Maybe the MathType
authors will give us a hint or provide such a macro.

   MathType can be downloaded from <http://www.dessci.com/> (30 day test
version).


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Math and Special Symbols,  Next: Tables,  Prev: Equations,  Up: Features

4.8 Math and Special Symbols
============================

The way that symbols are converted in the RTF is based on the following
observations.  If the symbol is found in the latin 1 character set, then
the current font is used, else the unicode code is inserted in the rtf
code.  (Implemented since version 2.1.0)

   The means that on the system where the '.rtf' file is opened, a
unicode font should be available or these glyphs will not be displayed
correctly.  As only the STIX fonts contain all needed characters, these
fonts should be installed on the system where the rtf file is to be
displayed or printed.

   Many mathematical and special symbols are directly supported by
LaTeX2RTF. Less common symbols (not found in the standard font) are
supported by the conversion table in the file 'direct.cfg', see *note
Direct Conversion::.

   Required fonts are:

   * "Times" / "Times New Roman" or "Helvetica" / "Arial", preferably
     with Unicode extension (i.e.  supporting all European languages
     including Cyrillic, Greek, and Hebrew).  "Times" or "Times New
     Roman" and "Helvetica" or "Arial" are standard on all systems, but
     not their Unicode extension.

   * "STIXGeneral" (4 fonts in plain, italic, bold, bold-italic).  These
     fonts are available from
     <http://sourceforge.net/projects/stixfonts/>.

     Note that while Office 2003 on Vista works correctly with the Open
     Type version, it does not on Windows XP (Word 2003 assigns no
     character spacing, and Publisher doesn't display the character at
     all).  On Windows XP, Office 2003 only displays the symbols
     correctly with the TrueType (ttf) version of the fonts.  But
     stixfonts.org only supplies the Open Type (otf) version.  TrueType
     versions of the fonts can be downloaded from
     <http://sites.google.com/site/olegueret/stixfonts-ttf>.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Tables,  Next: Graphics,  Prev: Math and Special Symbols,  Up: Features

4.9 Tables
==========

Conversion of tabular and tabbing environments is somewhat lame.  The
main difficulty is that LaTeX (and html) will size the columns of a
table automatically.  There is no such feature in RTF. Consequently, the
conversion defaults to making all the columns have equal size.  This is
suboptimal and should be revised.

   Another way is to use the option -t2 to make latex render them as
bitmaps and insert the bitmaps into the RTF file.  This feature was
added in version 1.9.19.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Graphics,  Next: Pagestyles,  Prev: Tables,  Up: Features

4.10 Graphics
=============

There is now rudimentary support for '\includegraphics'.  Three file
types will be inserted into the RTF file without needing conversion:
'.pict', '.jpeg', and '.png' files.  EPS and PDF files are converted to
PNG using 'convert' from the ImageMagick package.  Some options are even
handled properly.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Pagestyles,  Next: Hyperlatex,  Prev: Graphics,  Up: Features

4.11 Pagestyles
===============

If there is no '\pagestyle' command, the RTF output is generated as with
plain pagestyle, i.e.  each page has its page number centered at the
bottom.

   You must turn this off with the \pagestyle{empty} command in the
LaTeX file if you don't want pagenumbers.  The headings and myheadings
styles are silently ignored by now.  The twosided option to the
\documentstyle or \documentclass produces the corresponding RTF tokens.
Note that these features require RTF Version 1.4.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Hyperlatex,  Next: APA Support,  Prev: Pagestyles,  Up: Features

4.12 Hyperlatex
===============

Hyperlatex support is largely broken at the moment, but continues to
improve.

   Otfried Schwarzkopf has created the "Hyperlatex Markup Language"
which is a "little package that allows you to use LaTeX to prepare
documents in HTML." It brings an Emacs lisp program with it to convert
the Hyperlatex file to HTML. Hyperlatex can be obtained from the
CTAN-sites, see *note Obtaining LaTeX2RTF::.  There are two convenient
commands that avoid typing: \link and \xlink that generate an "internal"
label which then is used in the following \Ref and \Pageref commands.

   LaTeX makes it possible to write '\link{anchor}[ltx]{label}', which
typesets: 'anchor ltx'.  LaTeX2RTF does NOT support this aproach since
the optional parameter is thrown away right now, see *note LaTeX2RTF
under Development::.

   Note that you have to update your '.cfg' files if you are upgrading,
since there are a lot of HTML oriented commands in Hyperlatex that we
simply can 'ignore'.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: APA Support,  Prev: Hyperlatex,  Up: Features

4.13 APA Support
================

Some APA citation styles are supported, see *note Citation Commands::

   Support for APA text formatting is only rudimentary at the moment
(headings without numbering).  If you want to format a document
according to APA, rename cfg/style.cfg to style_sav.cfg and rename
cfg/styleAPA.cfg to style.cfg before starting LaTeX2RTF.

5.1 Input processing
====================

On processing input LaTeX2RTF first converts the LaTeX special
characters.  If it encounters one of the standard commands it is
converted internally.  If a command is not known to LaTeX2RTF it is
first looked up in 'direct.cfg' and the RTF code specified there is
output.  If not found there it is looked up in the section 'ignore.cfg'.
This file includes a lot of LaTeX commands that do not affect the output
(cross reference information and the like), or that we are not able or
willing to convert to RTF.

   You can use 'ignore.cfg' if you get tired of seeing
     WARNING: command: `foo' not found - ignored

and you don't need 'foo' in your RTF document.  It would be nice to send
your additions to the LaTeX2RTF mailing list for inclusion in later
distributions.

   LaTeX2RTF accepts Unix, MS-DOS, and Macintosh line ending codes (\n,
\r\n and \r).  The files it creates get the line ending for the platform
on which LaTeX2RTF was compiled.

   The LaTeX file may have been created with a wide variety of character
sets.  If the LaTeX lacks the '\package[codepage]{inputenc}' definition,
then you may need to use the command line switch to manually select the
proper code page (*note Input Encoding::).


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Conditional Parsing,  Next: Output Formatting,  Prev: Input Processing,  Up: Configuration

5.2 Conditional Parsing
=======================

Starting with LaTeX2RTF 1.9.18, there is a handy method for controlling
which content should be processed by LaTeX or by LaTeX2RTF. Control is
achieved using the standard '\if' facility of TeX.  If you include the
following line in the preamble of your document (i.e., before
'\begin{document}')

     \newif\iflatextortf

   Then you will create a new '\iflatextortf' command in LaTeX. TeX sets
the value of this to 'false' by default.  Now, LaTeX2RTF internally sets
'\iflatextortf' to be true, and to ensure that this is always the case,
LaTeX2RTF ignores the command '\latextortffalse'.  This means that you
can control how different applications process your document by

     \iflatextortf
     This code is processed only by latex2rtf
     \else
     This code is processed only by latex
     \fi

   Note that '\iflatextortf' will only work within a section; you cannot
use this command to conditionally parse code that crosses section
boundaries.  Also, it will only work on complete table or figure
environments.  Due to the mechanism used by LaTeX2RTF in processing
these environments, at this time the only way to conditionally parse
tables and figures is to include two complete versions of the
environment in question, nested within an appropriate '\iflatex2rtf'
structure.

   LaTeX2RTF versions 1.9.15 to 1.9.18 had the ability to hide contents
from LaTeX but expose them to LaTeX2RTF by starting a line with
'%latex2rtf:'.  This code was horribly broken, and it was removed.  The
same functionality is readily achieved using the '\iflatextortf'
mechanism.  For example, the old method allowed

     %latex2rtf: This line will only appear in the latex2rtf output,
   To get the same behavior, define '\iflatextortf' and use

     \iflatextortf
     This code is processed only by latex2rtf
     \fi

5.3 Output Formatting
=====================

On writing output, LaTeX2RTF generates the operating system specific
line ending code ('\n' on Unix, '\r\n' on DOS or Windows), depending on
which system LaTeX2RTF was compiled.  As both should be legal to any RTF
Reader the resulting RTF rendering should not be affected.

   LaTeX2RTF does not offer a whole lot of flexibility in how files are
translated, but it does offer some.  This flexibility resides in four
files 'direct.cfg', 'ignore.cfg', 'fonts.cfg', and 'language.cfg'.
These filese are documented in the next four sections.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Direct Conversion,  Next: Ignore Command,  Prev: Output Formatting,  Up: Configuration

5.4 Direct Conversion
=====================

The file 'direct.cfg' is used for converting LaTeX commands by simple
text replacement.  The format consists of lines with a LaTeX command
with backslash followed by comma.  The rest of the line until a '.'
character will be written to the RTF file when the command is found in
the LaTeX file.  Lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.  After
the '.' everything is ignored to end of line.  To select a specific font
use '*fontname*', where 'fontname' be defined in 'fonts.cfg'.  To write
the '*' character use '**'.

\bigstar,{\u8727**}.
\copyright,\'a9.

   In general, specific fonts should not be specified in this file.
There is a mechanism to do this, but it turns out that this is not as
useful as originally thought.  The main reason that this fails is
because the conversion of equations from Word fields to Equation Editor
objects is buggy.  The consequence is that to have symbols show up
properly, they must be encoded differently when the Symbol and MT Extra
fonts are used -- depending on whether Word fields are active or not.
It was all very tedious to figure out a mechanism that was "least
broken."


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Ignore Command,  Next: Font Configuration,  Prev: Direct Conversion,  Up: Configuration

5.5 Ignore Command
==================

The file 'ignore.cfg' is used for defining how to ignore specific
commands.  This file is used for recognition of LaTeX variables, user
defined variables, and some simple commands.  All variables are ignored
but the converter must know the names to correctly ignore assignments to
variables.  Lines in this file consist of a variable name with
backslash, followed by comma and the type of the variable followed by
'.'.  Possible types are

'NUMBER'
     simple numeric value
'MEASURE'
     numeric value with following unit of measure
'OTHER'
     ignores anything to the first character after '=' and from there to
     next space.  e.g., '\setbox\bak=\hbox'
'COMMAND'
     ignores anything to next '\' and from there to the occurence of
     anything but a letter e.g., '\newbox\bak'
'SINGLE'
     ignores single command e.g., '\noindent'
'PARAMETER'
     ignores a command with one parameter e.g., '\foo{bar}'
'PACKAGE'
     does not produce a Warning message if PACKAGE is encountered, e.g.,
     ''\kleenex,PACKAGE.'' ignores ''\usepackage{kleenex}''
'ENVCMD'
     intended to process contents of unknown environment as if it were
     plain LaTeX, e.g. ''\environ,ENVCMD.''
     Therefore ''\begin{environ} text \end{environ}'' would be converted
     to 'text'.  Doesn't work in LaTeX2RTF version 2.1.0 up to and
     including 2.3.4.
'ENVIRONMENT'
     ignores contents of that environment, e.g., with
     ''\ifhtml,ENVIRONMENT.'", ''\begin{ifhtml} text \end{ifhtml}''
     ignores 'text'.

   The types are in upper case exactly as above.  Do not use spaces.
Lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.  After the '.'
everything is ignored to end of line.  Example:
     \pagelength,MEASURE.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Font Configuration,  Next: Language Configuration,  Prev: Ignore Command,  Up: Configuration

5.6 Font Configuration
======================

The file 'fonts.cfg' contains the font name mapping.  For example, this
file determines what font is used to represent '\rm' characters in the
RTF file.

   A line consists of a font name in LaTeX followed by comma and a font
name in RTF. The end is marked by a '.'.  No spaces are allowed.  The
LaTeX font will be converted to the RTF font when it is found in the
LaTeX file.  If multiple translations for the same LaTeX font are
specified, only the first is used.  All fonts in a LaTeX file that are
not in this file will be mapped to the default font.  All RTF fonts
listed in this file will be in every RTF file header whether used or
not.  Lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.  After the '.'
everything is ignored to end of line.

   To add a RTF font not used as substitute for a LaTeX font -- for
example a Symbol font used in 'direct.cfg' -- use a dummy LaTeX name
like in the following
     Dummy3,MathematicalSymbols.

   Make sure you use the correct font name.  Take care of spaces in font
names.  The default fonts are named Roman '\rm', Slanted '\sl', Sans
Serif '\sf', Typewriter '\tt', or Calligraphic '\cal'.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Language Configuration,  Prev: Font Configuration,  Up: Configuration

5.7 Language Configuration
==========================

The file(s) 'language.cfg' control the translation of LaTeX's
"hardcoded" sectioning names.  The standard LaTeX styles have some fixed
Title names like 'Part', 'Reference' or 'Bibliography' that appeared in
English or German in the output with the original versions of LaTeX2RTF.

   It is unlikely that you will need to create a new 'language.cfg'
file.  However, just look at one of the existing files and follow the
pattern.  The format is really simple.

6 Error Messages and Logging
****************************

As stated in the Debugging section, LaTeX2RTF provides a means to
control the amount of debugging information through the '-d#' switch.
By using a debugging level of 4, you can get a pretty good idea of what
LaTeX command caused the problem and what line that command might be
found on.  Warnings and error messages are output to stderr and by
default listed in the console window.  They can be redirected to a file
"latex2rtf.log" by appending '2>latex2rtf.log' to the command line.

'Fatal error messages'
     indicate a bug in the source code.  PLEASE report them, if they do
     not apear in the documentation (*note Reporting Bugs::).

'Error messages'
     always abort the program and are caused by conditions that prevent
     further conversion of the input file.  Typically this is cause by
     LaTeX2RTF getting hopelessly confused by the number of braces in
     the LaTeX file.

'Warning messages'
     inform you, that there is some conversion loss from LaTeX to RTF,
     or that the output file has some restrictions on some RTF Readers.
     Most of these warnings can be supressed by add the offending
     command to the 'ignore.cfg' file.

   Error and Warning messages should follow the GNU Coding standards,
i.e.  they have the format
     inputfile':line: Error|Warning: message

   You can also control the level of debugging output by inserting
'\verbositylevel{#}' in the LaTeX file.  This is very handy if you have
a large LaTeX file that is failing in only a small section.  For
example,
     problem free latex file ....
     \verbositylevel{5}
     problematic code
     \verbositylevel{0}
will cause a huge amount of debugging information to be emitted for the
problematic code.

   Error reporting and logging still has many inconsistencies, but it
gets better with each release.  Don't try to make any sense in debugging
levels above 4, these are for my own delight only and can change
significantly between versions.

   The 'inputfile' may be incorrectly identified if it is incorporated
through '\input' or '\include'.  The line may be also be wrong at times.
*Note Known Bugs::.

7 History & Copyright
*********************

In 1994 the first Version of LaTeX2RTF was written by Fernando Dorner
and Andreas Granzer of the Viena University supervised by Ralf
Schlatterbeck in a one-semester course.  They created a simple LaTeX
parser and added most of the infrastructure for the program.  This was
version 1.0 of LaTeX2RTF. In 1995, work on LaTeX2RTF was continued in
another one-semester course by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard Trisko.  The
result was LaTeX2RTF version 1.5.  Ralf Schlatterbeck (ralf "at"
zoo.priv.at) maintained and extended LaTeX2RTF until 1998.

   In 1998 Georg Lehner (jorge_lehner "at" gmx.net) found the reference
to LaTeX2RTF on the TeX Conversion Webpage
(http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/index.html) of Wilfried Hennings and
added some functionality and took over the maintainence of the program.
The last version release by Georg is 1.8aa.  The bulk of development
post 1.8aa was done by Scott Prahl.  Wilfried Hennings now coordinates
the development of the program and maintains the project on SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/) where there are also (low
volume) mailing lists for users and developers.  Mailing via one of
these lists requires subscription to the list (to prevent spam).  For
subscription to these lists visit the page: users list
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/latex2rtf-users) or
developers list
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/latex2rtf-developers)

   As of June 2016, version 2.3.11 of LaTeX2RTF is available.

   The contents of this manual were composed by copying shamelessly what
was available in the original sources and documentation.

File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Unimplemented Features,  Next: Missing options,  Prev: LaTeX2RTF under Development,  Up: LaTeX2RTF under Development

8.1 Unimplemented Features
==========================

   * LaTeX2RTF ignores some optional parameters of '\documentstyle'
   * Add the code to produce the corresponding chapter, section, and
     page numbering with headings and myheadings pagestyles.  Implement
     '\markboth' and '\markright'.
   * To support '\tableofcontents' there would be two approaches:
     Transfer sectioning information, title text and then produce page
     numbers by the rtf- reader.  Scan and label all of the sectioning
     commands while reading and then construct the sectioning
     information using these labels.  Needs two passes on LaTeX input.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Missing options,  Next: Known Bugs,  Prev: Unimplemented Features,  Up: LaTeX2RTF under Development

8.2 Missing options
===================

Missing or buggy command line options.

'-d'
     Information logging and Error reporting is not implemented
     consistently.  Need to test and track problems with the linenumber
     and with the file name.

'--long_names'
     It would be useful to implement the GNU long option names, e.g.:
     '-debug', '-output_file', '-quiet', etc.  This could be done by
     switching to the GNU getopt package.


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Known Bugs,  Next: Reporting Bugs,  Prev: Missing options,  Up: LaTeX2RTF under Development

8.3 Known Bugs
==============

  1. The first parameter of a \link{anchor}[ltx]{label} is converted to
     the rtf-output.  Label is stored to hyperref for later use, the
     optional parameter is ignored.  [ltx] should be processed as
     Otfried recommends it, to use for exclusive LaTeX output.e.g:
     \link{readhere}[~\Ref]{explaining: chapter}.  Since
     {explaining:chapter} is yet read by LaTeX and hyperlatex when [...]
     is evaluated it produces the correct reference.  LaTeX2RTF is only
     strolling from left to right through the text and can't remember
     what she will see in the future.
  2. The diagnostics routine does not output the correct (actual) input
     filename.  ('.aux', '.bbl', '\input').


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Reporting Bugs,  Next: Todo List,  Prev: Known Bugs,  Up: LaTeX2RTF under Development

8.4 Reporting Bugs
==================

Report bugs to to the bug tracking system at SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/).  Only report bugs for the
latest version of LaTeX2RTF that is available.  Please provide the
following information and observe the following guidelines when
reporting a bug in the program:
  1. State the version of LaTeX2RTF that you are using.  You can get the
     version by specifying the '-V' option to LaTeX2RTF.

  2. Specify the your operating system and version.  Be sure to check
     the file 'Makefile' for settings that may be specific to your
     machine, especially for some versions of SunOS there may be
     settings which are needed to compile successfully.  Do this before
     submitting a bug report.

  3. If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you,
     include a short LaTeX file along with a description of the problem.
     Isolating the bug into a small LaTeX file does two things.  First,
     it provides a file that can be used to test future versions of
     LaTeX2RTF and second, it certainly improves the chances that the
     bug will get some attention.  Do not send me large LaTeX or RTF
     files, I simply do not have the time to wade through large files to
     search for a bug!

  4. Be patient.  I am maintaining the program in my free time.  I did
     not write most of the code.  Often I do not have the time to answer
     to your question.  I will, however, try to fix reported bugs in
     upcoming releases.

8.6 Command List
================

Listed here are all the LaTeX commands currently parsed by LaTeX2RTF.
Note: inclusion in this list does not mean that a command is fully and
correctly handled by LaTeX2RTF. In some cases the commands here are
place-holders only, and are not implemented at all.  The list is
provided to encourage developers to note any departures from the
behaviour that LaTeX users will expect.  The location of the commands is
noted to assist anyone interested in hacking on the C source code.  This
list is a work in progress, and may not be immediately useful to general
users, other than to indicate those commands that we have at least
contemplated implementing.
