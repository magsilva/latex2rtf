<p><a id="Introduction"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>LaTeX2RTF
is a translator program from LaTeX text into &ldquo;rich text
format&rdquo; files. These files are commonly referred to as RTF files. RTF
is a published standard format by Microsoft. This standard can be
ambiguous in places and Microsoft ignores parts of the standard it finds
inconvenient, but RTF is widely used by many WYSIWIG text editors and is
supported by Microsoft Word and most text processors.

<p>LaTeX2RTF
translates the text and as much of the formatting information
from LaTeX to RTF. Be forewarned that the typeset output is not
nearly as good as what you would get from using LaTeX
directly. So, why bother translating? Consider,

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>You use LaTeX
and hate everything beginning with MS-<small class="enddots">....</small>
Nevertheless, you have to share your documents with people who don't
even know that there are alternatives to MS-<small class="enddots">....</small>

     <li>You know somebody who frequently sends you very fine LaTeX
documents. 
Unfortunately, you are &ldquo;on the other side&rdquo; and need to import her
files, steal some part, and then desktop publish it in your fine
MS-<small class="dots">...</small> environment.

     <li>You like LaTeX and BibTeX. You interact with the rest of the
world. You know someone that wants to include your writing in a Word
document.

     </ol>

   <p>There are drawbacks to the conversion process. In fact, don't expect any LaTeX
file to
be converted as you would like, don't expect it to be converted without errors or
warnings, and don't be especially surprised when it doesn't convert at all.  LaTeX2RTF
is
known to have many bugs and many missing features. Paradoxically, this number seems to
grow more and more with each day.  However, we can categorically state that there are some
special cases in which a LaTeX file will be translated to RTF satisfactorily by
LaTeX2RTF &mdash; This was sort of disclaimer, ok? OK!

   <p>LaTeX is a system for typesetting text and therefore it focuses on the logical
structure of a document, whilst RTF is meant to be a transport format for a family of
Desktop Publishing Software, dealing mostly with the design of a text.

   <p>Although the commands and styles in LaTeX are much more flexible and
standardized than in RTF, only a small subset of commands has been implemented to date
(see <a href="#Unimplemented-Features">Unimplemented Features</a>).

   <p>Some of the capabilities of LaTeX2RTF
are restricted in scope or buggy (see <a href="#Known-Bugs">Known Bugs</a>).

   <p><a id="index-RTF-sucks-1"></a>RTF is a moving target, because Microsoft does not stop inventing new extensions and
features; consequently you cannot view newer RTF files with older word processors. 
The syntax and semantics of RTF are somewhat artistic, i.e., you can generate a
syntactically correct RTF file that cannot be displayed by some/most word processors. 
For more details on RTF the specification consult the links at <a href="http://latex2rtf.sf.net/">http://latex2rtf.sf.net/</a>

<p><a id="Installation"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Installation</h2>

<p><a id="index-installation-2"></a>

<p><a id="General"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.1 General</h3>

<p>The documentation of the program is found in the <span class="file">doc/</span> directory
in the file <span class="file">latex2rtf.texi</span> in the GNU TeXInfo format. 
For your convenience, you can find <acronym>HTML</acronym> and <acronym>PDF</acronym>
versions of the manual there as well.<br>
Note: In this manual, the terms "directory" and "folder" are used interchangeably.

<p><a id="Obtaining-LaTeX2RTF"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Obtaining LaTeX2RTF
</h3>

<p>LaTeX2RTF
is available for many Unix Platforms, for the Macintosh, and for MS-DOS,
including all versions of MS Windows.

<p>The latest version of LaTeX2RTF
is available at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a>
and &mdash; with some delay &mdash; on CTAN sites:
e.g., <a href="http://www.dante.de">http://www.dante.de</a> or <a href="http://www.ctan.org">http://www.ctan.org</a>.

   <p>The DOS package will also run under all MS Windows versions
up to Windows 7, except 64bit systems. 
It requires an i386 processor or better.<br>
It should only be used on older Microsoft systems.<br>
For Win9x, ME, NT, or newer, you should use the win or win-NO-GUI package.

   <p>The win-NO-GUI package only runs under Win32
(Win9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, Win7). 
From LaTeX2RTF version 2.0.0 up it also runs on 64bit systems.

   <p>The win package is the win-NO-GUI package plus graphical user
interface (GUI) shell (l2rshell) and installer.<br>
It only runs under Win NT, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, and Win7.<br>
From LaTeX2RTF version 2.0.0 up it also runs on 64bit systems.

   <p>The win64 package (only LaTeX2RTF version 1.9.19) is the win package
but with 32bit versions of the shell utilities so that it also runs
on 64bit systems. From LaTeX2RTF version 2.0.0 up, there is no separate
win64 package, as the win32 package will also run on 64bit systems.

   <p>There are a few people working on LaTeX2RTF, and some more make
contributions, coordinated by
Wilfried Hennings (texconvfaq &ldquo;at&rdquo; gmx.de). 
See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a>
project pages for the latest news.

<p><a id="UNIX"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.3 UNIX</h3>

<p>To install,
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Edit <span class="file">Makefile</span> for your local configuration.  In particular, pay attention
to the <span class="env">PREFIX</span> variable.  If you do not have root access you might wish
to set the makefile variable <span class="env">PREFIX</span> to be your home directory.

     <p>On some machines the cc compiler will issue errors. Therefore the
default compiler command in the Makefile is <code>CC=gcc</code>.

     <li>From version 1.9.13 up, LaTeX2RTF supports conversion of LaTeX equations to
bitmaps using the shell script <span class="file">latex2png</span>, 
found in <span class="file">scripts/</span>. 
<span class="file">latex2png</span> requires that both LaTeX
and <span class="file">ImageMagick</span> are installed. LaTeX2RTF
will translate documents without a working <span class="file">latex2png</span>, but some
features will be missing.  You can verify that the <span class="file">latex2png</span> script
is working by typing <code>make</code> in the <span class="file">scripts/</span> directory.

     <li><code>make</code>

     <p>If this is not your first time installation, you may want to preserve
your old configuration (<span class="file">*.cfg</span>) files. Copy them to a safe place
before installing.

     <p>On IBM AIX, the IBM make utility does not support some of the commands
used in Makefile. In this case use <code>gmake</code> (from GNU) instead.

     <p>Sun has decided to support the XPG4 standard on Solaris by an
alternative set of binaries.  To allow bitmap conversion of equations, two
things are needed.  First, change the first line of latex2png to <code>#!/usr/xpg4/bin/sh</code>
Second, define the XPG4_GREP environment variable accordingly,
for bash-like shells <code>XPG4_GREP=/usr/xpg4/bin/grep; export XPG4_GREP</code> or
for tsch-like shells <code>setenv XPG4_GREP /usr/xpg4/bin/grep</code>.

     <li><code>make install</code>

     <p>If your <code>mkdir</code> doesn't support the <span class="option">-p</span> option, then create
the necessary directories by hand and remove the option from the
<code>$MKDIR</code> variable. If you have other problems, just copy
<span class="file">latex2rtf</span> and <span class="file">latex2png</span> to a binary directory, and move
the contents of the <span class="file">cfg/</span> directory to the location specified by
<code>$CFG_INSTALL</code>.

     <li><code>make check</code>

     <p>[OPTIONAL] This tests LaTeX2RTF on a variety of LaTeX files.  Expect
a whole lot of warnings, but no outright errors. (On IBM AIX, use <code>gmake check</code>.) 
Note that this will check the basic functionality of the <span class="file">latex2png</span>
script, and then that of <span class="file">latex2rtf</span>.

     <li><code>make install-info</code>

     <p>[OPTIONAL] This installs <span class="file">.info</span> files for use with the <code>info</code>
program.

        </ol>

   <p>You no longer need to define the environment variable <span class="env">RTFPATH</span>. This
is only necessary if you move the directory containing the <span class="file">.cfg</span> files. 
Just define <span class="env">RTFPATH</span> to be the path for the new location of the <span class="file">cfg</span>
directory.

<p><a id="DOS-or-Windows"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.4 DOS</h3>

<p>The <acronym>UNIX</acronym> and Mac packages do not contain an executable for DOS
or Windows. You may compile it yourself (with djgpp or MinGW) or get the <br>
DOS package as file <span class="file">latex2rtf-x.x.x_dos.zip</span>
(where x.x.x is the version number) <br>
or the win-NO-GUI package as file <span class="file">latex2rtf-x.x.x_win-NO-GUI.zip</span>
(no installer, no graphical user interface (GUI))<br>
from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a><br>

   <p>The DOS package contains a precompiled executable
which should run under plain DOS and also in the command prompt
(or &ldquo;console&rdquo;) of any MS Windows system including Vista and Windows 7
but not on 64bit systems.<br>

   <p>To install the DOS or win-no-GUI package of LaTeX2RTF, extract all files
from the zip archive, preserving the folder structure
(winzip: check &ldquo;use folder names&rdquo;),
preferably to <span class="file">C:\l2r</span>, or under Windows, to your "Program Files"
folder (which ever it is named in your system)
because then it will find its cfg files by default.<br>
If you extracted them to another folder (e.g. <span class="file">C:\my_files\l2r</span>),
either edit the file <span class="file">L2RPREP.BAT</span>
and change the folder <span class="file">C:\l2r</span> to where you put them, or specify the
path to the cfg folder in the command line.<br>
Avoid blanks in folder and file names!

   <p>Make sure that the folder containing the file <span class="file">L2RPREP.BAT</span>
is in your search path, or put this file into a folder
which is in your search path.<br>
To display the current search path, enter <span class="file">PATH</span>
from the command prompt (with no arguments).

   <p>Under plain DOS, conversion of equations or figures to bitmaps is not
possible because Ghostscript and ImageMagick are not available
for plain DOS.

<p><a id="Win32-systems"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.5 MS Windows systems</h3>

<p>To install LaTeX2RTF
on a MS Windows system (WinNT, Win2000, WinXP,
Vista, Win7), download the win package,
execute the <span class="file">latex2rtf-x.x.x_win.exe</span>
(where x.x.x is the version number) and follow the instructions.

   <p>Note: The installer and GUI shell do not support Win9x and WinMe
since LaTeX2RTF v.1.9.17. 
If you have one of these systems, you should use the
win-NO-GUI package (1.9.19 and up) of LaTeX2RTF.

   <p>To start the program double-click the LaTeX2RTF icon,
or drag and drop a <span class="file">.tex</span> file onto the icon.

   <p>If your LaTeX
document refers to external graphic files, e.g. eps,
or you want to use the option to convert equations to bitmaps,
you must have LaTeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript installed. These programs are
freely available for download at <a href="http://www.miktex.org/">http://www.miktex.org/</a>,
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">http://www.imagemagick.org</a> and 
<a href="http://www.ghostscript.com">http://www.ghostscript.com</a>

   <p>The following versions were available at the time of writing
and tested together with LaTeX2RTF version 2.3.9: <br>
- MikTeX 2.9 <br>
- Ghostscript 9.10 or 9.15 <br>
- ImageMagick-6.8.9-8-Q16-x86-dll.exe

   <p>If MikTeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed, the paths to their
executables are detected automatically. If for any reason this doesn't
happen, these paths can be specified manually in the &ldquo;Environment&rdquo;
tab of the LaTeX2RTF GUI shell window.

   <p>If you need to start LaTeX2RTF not from its own shell but from commandline
or another Windows application, you need to add the folder containing
the latex2png script and the helper programs to the search path.<br>
Some applications (e.g. Lyx) allow to temporarily add the path by
specifying it in the options.<br>
If this is not possible, you can add the latex2rtf folder to Windows'
default path like follows:

   <p>To add a folder &ndash; e.g. C:\Program Files\latex2rtf &ndash; to the search path:
     <ul>
<li>Note that the folder name "Program Files" contains a blank. 
This would lead to some problems as some parts of the latex2rtf program
package interpret the blank as a parameter delimiter. 
Therefore in the following example the folder name "Program Files" is
replaced by its DOS equivalent "PROGRA~1" which has the additional
effect that this is similar for several if not all European languages.<br>
<li>Win95, Win98, WinME
          <ul>
<li>Open the file <span class="file">C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT</span> either with Edit (DOS) or
with Notepad (Windows). 
<li>At the end of that file, add the line
<span class="file">PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\latex2rtf;%PATH%</span>
<li>Save the file to its original location. Shutdown and reboot the PC.<br>
</ul>
     <li>WinNT, Win2000, WinXP, Vista, Win7
          <ul>
<li>Right-click &ldquo;My Computer&rdquo; (German: &ldquo;Arbeitsplatz&rdquo;), then select &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;;
<li>NT: Click the &ldquo;Environment&rdquo; tab;<br>
XP and up: Click the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; tab, then the &ldquo;Environment variables&rdquo; button;
<li>Find the line beginning with <span class="file">PATH=</span> and insert the string <br>
<span class="file">C:\PROGRA~1\latex2rtf;</span><br>
so that the complete line looks like <br>
<span class="file">PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\latex2rtf;C:\WINDOWS;...</span>
<li>Click "OK"
</ul>
     </ul>

   <p>If you do NOT use the GUI (l2rshell.exe),
either the folders where TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed
must also be in your search path, or you must edit the file <span class="file">L2RPREP.BAT</span>,
ensure that the pathes in this file point to the folders where
TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed on your machine,
and call <span class="file">l2rprep</span> before calling <span class="file">latex2rt</span>. <br>
Or you edit <span class="file">l2r.bat</span> and call <span class="file">l2r</span> instead of
calling <span class="file">latex2rt</span>.

   <p>If you DO use the GUI (l2rshell.exe), the TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript folders
are automatically added to the search path by the GUI.

   <p>When equations are to be converted to bitmaps, for each equation LaTeX2RTF
first writes a temporary l2r_nnnn.tex file to disk which consists
of only the equation to be converted. It then sends the call
for <span class="file">"bash latex2png l2r_nnnn.tex"</span> to the operating system. <br>
In previous versions of latex2rtf, some users got the message
&ldquo;Out of environment space&rdquo; (can occur only under Windows 95, Windows 98
or Windows ME); this should be solved now by using bash.exe instead of command.com.

<p><a id="Macintosh"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.6 Macintosh</h3>

<p>If you want a MacOS X version, make sure that you have installed the developer tools CD
that is appropriate for your OS version, and then follow the directions above for a
<acronym>UNIX</acronym> installation.  Alternatively you can install using fink
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">http://fink.sourceforge.net/</a> or as an i-installer package
<a href="http://www.rna.nl/ii.html">http://www.rna.nl/ii.html</a>.

   <p>As of 2006-01-30 there also is a GUI shell for Macintosh.<br>
See <a href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/fischerk/LaTeX2rtf/index.html">http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/fischerk/LaTeX2rtf/index.html</a>

   <p>There is a PPC port of an old version 1.9k for Classic MacOS LaTeX2RTF
. 
To convert a LaTeX file using this version,  drag the file onto the LaTeX2RTF icon.  The
translation is best if there are <span class="file">.aux</span> and 
<span class="file">.bbl</span> files in the same folder as
the <span class="file">.tex</span> file to be converted.  
These should be generated using LaTeX and
<span class="file">bibtex</span>.

<p><a id="Problems-Compiling"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.7 Problems Compiling</h3>

<p>The code for LaTeX2RTF
is standard <acronym>ANSI</acronym> C.  Some possible pitfalls are
     <ul>
<li>Not correctly defining your compiler in the Makefile. 
The default is to use <code>gcc</code>.

     <li>Encountering errors because the compiler options.  During development
all compiler warnings are turned on.  However, different compilers have
different interpretations of <span class="option">-Wall</span> and
may generate errors that were not found in a different development
system.  Please report these, but a quick fix is to remove all compiler
options.

   </ul>

<p><a id="Problems-with-make-check"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.8 Problems with <code>make check</code></h3>

<p>All the files in the <span class="file">test</span> directory are converted (with varying degrees
of success) using LaTeX2RTF and are tested before most CVS check-ins and with
all released tarballs.  There will be many warning messages, but there should
be no actual error messages.  If you do not have a working latex2png script, then
some of the files will fail to be translated.

<p><a id="Using-LaTeX2RTF"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Using LaTeX2RTF</h2>

<p><a id="General-Assumptions"></a>

<h3 class="section">3.1 General Assumptions</h3>

<p>LaTeX2RTF
assumes that the <span class="file">.tex</span> file you want to convert is a valid
LaTeX document.  The chances of a successful LaTeX2RTF conversion are slightly better than the
proverbial snowball's if the <span class="file">.tex</span> file doesn't <code>latex</code> properly.  Use
LaTeX to find and correct errors before using LaTeX2RTF
.<br>
LaTeX2RTF also needs the <span class="file">.aux</span> file and <span class="file">.bbl</span> file
which are generated by running <code>latex</code> on the <span class="file">.tex</span> file

<p>To correctly convert font names you must edit the <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span> configuration file. 
This file is used to specify the needed font names and how the LaTeX default font names
should be converted to RTF (see <a href="#Font-Configuration">Font Configuration</a>). LaTeX
variables and user defined commands are not evaluated. They will be simply ignored. To let LaTeX2RTF 
know the names of variables you can add them in the <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span> file 
(see <a href="#Ignore-Command">Ignore Command</a>).

   <p>The environment variable RTFPATH may contain a search path for the support files (all
files ending in <span class="file">.cfg</span>). If no file is found during the search in the search-path or
if the environment variable is not set, the compiled-in default for the configuration-file
directory is used. If the files are not found at all the program aborts.

   <p>In the DOS and Windows versions the search path is separated by `;' in the Unix version by `:'. For
the paths themselves apply `\' and `/'. A separator may appear at the beginning or ending
of RTFPATH.

   <p>Make sure that the configuration files are in the correct directory (or folder). LaTeX2RTF
will need at least <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span>, <span class="file">direct.cfg</span>, 
<span class="file">ignore.cfg</span>, <span class="file">english.cfg</span>. You may
have to change one ore more of them to suit your needs (see <a href="#Configuration">Configuration</a>).

   <p>See <a href="#Missing-options">Missing options</a>, for actual implementations irregularities.

   <p>See <a href="#Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>, for information on how to reach the maintainer.

<p><a id="LaTeX2RTF-Options"></a>

<h3 class="section">3.2 LaTeX2RTF
Options</h3>

<p>The LaTeX2RTF
command converts a LaTeX
file into RTF text format. The text and
much of the formatting information is translated to RTF making the new file
look similar to the original.  The command line syntax is:

<pre class="example">     latex2rtf [-options] inputfile[.tex]
</pre>
   <p>for the DOS and Windows versions:

<pre class="example">     latex2rt [-options] inputfile[.tex]
</pre>
   <p>The options set in the Windows GUI (l2rshell.exe) are inserted as
command line options when clicking RUN.

   <p>The <code>-options</code> may consist of one or more of the following

     <dl>
<dt><code>-a auxfile</code><dd>specify an <span class="file">.aux</span> file (for table and figure references) that
differs from <span class="file">inputfile.aux</span>. If this is omitted, the name of the
inputfile with the suffix replaced <span class="file">.aux'</span>will be taken.  You must
provide both files (<span class="file">.tex</span> and the <span class="file">.aux</span>) to be able to
convert cross-references in a LaTeX
file.  The <span class="file">.aux</span> is created
by running the <span class="file">inputfile.tex</span> through <code>latex</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-b bblfile</code><dd>Unless an <span class="file">bblfile</span> is specified with the <code>-b</code> option, 
LaTeX2RTF uses a <span class="file">inputfile.bbl</span>.  
The <span class="file">bblfile</span> file is used for citations and is typically
created by running <span class="file">inputfile.aux</span> through <span class="file">bibtex</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-C codepage</code><dd>used to specify the character set (code page) used in the LaTeX
document. This is only important when non-ansi characters are included in the LaTeX
document. Typically this is done in a LaTeX2e  file by using <code>\usepackage[codepage]{inputenc}</code>
and in this case you need not specify the -C codepage option. 
If NO <code>\usepackage[codepage]{inputenc}</code> is in the LaTeX2e  file, you must
inform the converter about the codepage by the -C codepage option. You may select any
of the following code pages: ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865,
decmulti, cp1250, cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9, next.  The
default behavior is to use ansinew (code page 1252).  Cyrillic support includes
conversion of koi8-r, koi8-u, cp1251, cp855, cp866, maccyr, and macukr encodings.

     <br><dt><code>-d debug_level</code><dd>The <span class="option">-d</span> 
option determines the amount of debugging information to send to
stderr while translating. debug_level=0 means only Errors, `1' Warning Messages
(default) also.  The debug_level can go as high as `7' for insane amounts of
debugging fun. Warnings and error messages are output to stderr and by default
listed in the console window. They can be redirected to a file &ldquo;latex2rtf.log&rdquo;
by appending <code>2&gt;latex2rtf.log</code> to the command line.

     <br><dt><code>-D dots_per_inch</code><dd>used to specify the number of dots per inch for equations converted to bitmaps. 
This value is also used when picture environments are converted to bitmaps as well
as when EPS graphics are converted to png files.  The default value is 300 dots per
inch.

     <br><dt><code>-E# selects whether figures are included in the rtf (default) or created</code><dd>as 
external files with the filenames inserted in the rtf text.

     <p>The options -E4, -E8 and -E12 are experimental and may not work as expected.

          <dl>
    <dt><code>-E0</code><dd>    Do not include any figures in RTF. 
    <br><dt><code>-E1</code><dd>    Include figures that need no conversion. 
    <br><dt><code>-E2</code><dd>    Include figures that need conversion. 
    <br><dt><code>-E3</code><dd>    Include all figures (default). 
    <br><dt><code>-E4</code><dd>    Insert filenames for figures that do not need conversion. 
    <br><dt><code>-E8</code><dd>    Insert filenames for figures that need conversion. 
    <br><dt><code>-E12</code><dd>    Insert filenames for all figures. 
    </dl>
     With options -E4, -E8 and -E12, pdf and ps are converted to eps
and the eps filenames inserted. Bitmap files are inserted in
their original format. 
After opening the rtf in a textprocessing or dtp program,
a macro can search for the inserted filenames
and insert the files in their places.

     <br><dt><code>-f#</code><dd>where # selects which fields to use during conversion:
          <dl>
    <dt><code>-f0</code><dd>    do not use fields in RTF.  This is handy when primitive RTF
    editors are being used to view the RTF output. 
    <br><dt><code>-f1</code><dd>    use fields for equations but not <code>\ref</code> and <code>\cite</code>. 
    <br><dt><code>-f2</code><dd>    use fields for <code>\ref</code> and <code>\cite</code> but not equations.  This
    will be useful for versions of OpenOffice that import cross-references
    properly (as of Sept 2003 in a soon-to-be released version) but do not properly
    handle fields in equations. 
    <br><dt><code>-f3</code><dd>    use fields when possible.  This is the default and is most useful when
    the RTF file is being exported to be used in Word.  This retains the most
    information from the original LaTeX
file. 
    </dl>

     <br><dt><code>-F</code><dd>use LaTeX to create bitmaps for all figures.  This may help when figures are
not translated properly with the default settings.  This typically requires
a functional version of ImageMagick on your machine to work properly.

     <br><dt><code>-h</code><dd>a short usage description

     <br><dt><code>-i language</code><dd>used to set the idiom or language used by the LaTeX
document.  Typically, this is specified in a LaTeX2e
 document by including <code>\usepackage[language]{babel}</code> where
<code>language</code> is one of the languages supported by the <code>babel</code> package. All
languages listed in the babel system are supported so far as translations for &ldquo;Chapter,&rdquo;
&ldquo;References,&rdquo; and the like.  Furthermore, some commands found in the style files for
german, french, russian, and czech style
are supported (see <a href="#Language-Configuration">Language Configuration</a>).

     <br><dt><code>-l</code><dd>same as <span class="option">-i latin1</span> (Note that the 
default behavior is to use <span class="option">ansinew</span>
which is a superset of <span class="option">latin1</span>). Included for
backwards compatibility.

     <br><dt><code>-M#</code><dd>where # selects the type of equation conversion.  Use
          <dl>
    <dt><code>-M1</code><dd>    convert displayed equations to RTF
    <br><dt><code>-M2</code><dd>    convert inline equations to RTF
    <br><dt><code>-M4</code><dd>    convert displayed equations to bitmap
    <br><dt><code>-M8</code><dd>    convert inline equations to bitmap
    <br><dt><code>-M16</code><dd>    insert Word comment field that contains the raw LaTeX equation
    <br><dt><code>-M32</code><dd>    insert the raw latex equation in the RTF text delimited by <code>$ ... $</code> for
    inline equations and by <code>\[ ... \]</code> for displayed equations.<br>
    This is useful when using version 6 of the MathType equation
    editor, which converts typed or pasted TeX code into a MathType equation.<br>
    Probably this could also be useful for use in OpenOffice, as OO has an
    equation syntax which partially resembles TeX syntax. 
    <br><dt><code>-M64</code><dd>    convert displayed equations to EPS files and insert filenames in RTF text. 
    <br><dt><code>-M128</code><dd>    convert inline equations to EPS files and insert filenames in RTF text. 
    </dl>
     These switches can be combined to get different effects.  Handy examples are
          <dl>
    <dt><code>-M3</code><dd>    convert both inline and displayed equations to RTF (default)
    <br><dt><code>-M6</code><dd>    convert inline equations to RTF and displayed equations to bitmaps
    <br><dt><code>-M12</code><dd>    convert both inline and displayed equations to bitmaps
    <br><dt><code>-M192</code><dd>    convert both inline and displayed equations to EPS and insert filenames in RTF text
    </dl>
     Conversion to bitmaps or eps requires that you have installed a working latex2png script. 
Producing bitmaps is slow.<br>
When running the DOS version, conversion to bitmaps works for the first 26
equations but fails for the rest with the message<br>
"latex2png: pipe error: Too many open files (EMFILE)".<br>
This is probably a bug in the djgpp 2.04 compiler.<br>
The Windows version, compiled with MinGW, successfully
converts at least 500 equations to bitmaps.<br>
When -M64, -M128 or both are specified, equations are converted to
individual eps files, the filenames of which are literally inserted in
the rtf file, delimited by [###...###]. After loading the rtf file in a
text processing program, a macro can be run which searches for "[###"
and "###]", extracts the filename, and inserts the eps in that place. 
The Windows installer package contains the code of such a macro for
Word2010 in the file "WordMacro_InsertEPSfromNames.txt" in subfolder
"scripts". (This macro may also run on other versions of Word but
it was only tested on Word2010.) In Word, the inserted eps graphics
display in bad quality on the screen and on non-postscript printers
but can be printed in high quality on postscript and pdf printers.

     <br><dt><code>-o outputfile</code><dd>Unless an <span class="file">outputfile</span> 
is specified with the <code>-o</code> option, the resulting RTF
filename is formed by removing <span class="file">.tex</span> from the <span class="file">inputfile</span> and appending
<span class="file">.rtf</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-p</code><dd>Escape parentheses in mathematical formulas.  This has no effect unless EQ fields
are being generated.  When this option is used, then a `(' or `)' that appears
in an EQ field will be preceeded by a backslash.  Despite documentation to the
contrary (which says that all parentheses should be escaped), adding escapes usually
produces a worse result than doing nothing. If Word displays some formulas with
parentheses as &ldquo;Error!&rdquo;, you might try this option as a last resort. 
See also the -S option.

     <p>This is an option because it will break typesetting equations with non-matching
parentheses (because an unmatched unquoted parenthesis would terminate the field).

     <br><dt><code>-P /path/to/cfg</code><dd>used to specify the folder (i.e. directory) that contains the <code>.cfg</code> files
and/or the folder that contains the latex2png script.<br>
Unix, Mac: The folder that contains the latex2png script must be prepended
by a ":".<br>
DOS, Windows: The scripts folder is not used, the
scripts are always taken from the search path, therefore the folder
containing the scripts and the helper programs must be the first in the search path. 
You can either add it to the search path permanently or add it temporarily by
calling l2rprep.bat before starting conversions.<br>
If any of the folder names contains a blank, the folder string must be
enclosed in single (Unix, Mac) or double (DOS, Windows) quotes.<br>
Examples:<br>
(Unix:) <code>latex2rtf -P ./cfg/:./scripts/ foo</code><br>
(DOS/Windows:) <code>latex2rt -P "C:\Program Files\latex2rtf\cfg" foo</code><br>
Note that without specifying the -P option, LaTeX2RTF
tries to find its cfg files in the following locations:<br>
1. the folder specified by the environment variable <code>RTFPATH</code>, if this variable exists;<br>
2. The folder <code>%PROGRAMFILES%\latex2rtf\cfg</code>, if the variable
<code>PROGRAMFILES</code> exists &ndash; this is the folder in which LaTeX2RTF is installed
by the Windows GUI installer with default settings;<br>
3. the folder specified at compilation time by the variable
<code>CFGDIR</code>. This is set in the Makefile. The DOS version is compiled
with <code>CFGDIR=C:/l2r</code>, the Windows version with
<code>CFGDIR=C:/PROGRA~1/latex2rtf</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-se#</code><dd>selects the scale for equation conversion, where # is the scale factor
(default 1.00).

     <br><dt><code>-sf#</code><dd>selects the scale for figure conversion, where # is the scale factor
(default 1.00).

     <br><dt><code>-t#</code><dd>where # selects the type of table conversion.  Use
          <dl>
    <dt><code>-t1</code><dd>    convert tables to RTF (default)
    <br><dt><code>-t2</code><dd>    convert tables to bitmaps
    </dl>

     <br><dt><code>-v or -V</code><dd>prints version information on standard output and exits.

     <br><dt><code>-S</code><dd>used to specify that semicolons should be used to separate arguments in RTF fields
(instead of commas).  Typically this is needed when the machine that opens the RTF file
has a version of Windows that uses `,' for decimal points.

     <br><dt><code>-T /path/to/tmp</code><dd>used to specify the folder where to put temporary files. 
The path can be absolute, e.g. <code>/path/to/tmp</code> or relative
to the folder where the .tex input file is in, e.g. <code>tmp</code> or <code>./tmp</code>.<br>
If you call LaTeX2RTF from the commandline (e.g. under Linux or
when called as export filter by LyX), make sure that the tmp folder exists. 
Only the LaTeX2RTF Windows shell tries to create the tmp folder,
the command line program doesn't.

     <br><dt><code>-W</code><dd>includes warnings directly in the RTF file

     <br><dt><code>-Z#</code><dd>add the specified number of extra <code>}</code> 
to the end of the RTF file.  This is useful for files that are not cleanly converted by LaTeX2RTF.

   </dl>

   <p>With no arguments other than switches starting with a &ldquo;-&rdquo;,
LaTeX2RTF acts as a filter, i.e., it reads from <code>stdin</code> and writes
to <code>stdout</code>. 
In addition, diagnostic messages are sent to <code>stderr</code>. 
If these standard channels are not redirected using <code>&lt;</code>
and <code>&gt;</code>, then the input is read from the command line,
and both output and error messages are printed on the screen. 
To redirect warnings and error messages to a file
&ldquo;latex2rtf.log&rdquo;, append <code>2&gt;latex2rtf.log</code> to the command line.

   <p>If a non-switch argument is present, LaTeX2RTF assumes it is the name of
the input file. The file must have extension &ldquo;.tex&rdquo; but the extension
is optional. The output file is constructed from the input file name
by removing the extension &ldquo;.tex&rdquo; and adding &ldquo;.rtf&rdquo;.

<p><a id="Debugging"></a>

<h3 class="section">3.3 Debugging</h3>

<p>With the <span class="option">-d</span> option you can specify how much processing information
LaTeX2RTF reports. 
If there is a logfile specified the output goes to this file. Nonetheless
Warnings and Errors are logged to stderr always. They can be redirected
to a file &ldquo;latex2rtf.log&rdquo; by appending <code>2&gt;latex2rtf.log</code>
to the command line.

   <p>Possible values of <span class="option">-d</span> are
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>only errors. 
<li>Translation Warnings (default). 
<li>shows preparsing of sections
<li>Reasonably high level debugging messages
<li>Show all function calls
<li>Show each character as it is processed
<li>Show processing of characters as they are output as well
        </ol>

<p><a id="Features"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Features</h2>

<p>In this chapter you find what styles is LaTeX2RTF supposed to translate
correctly to RTF.

<p><a id="LaTeX2e"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.1 LaTeX2e</h3>

<p>LaTeX2RTF
understands most of the commands introduced with LaTeX2e.  It translates both
the old 2.09 version of <code>\documentstyle[options]{format#}</code> and the newer
<code>\documentclass[options]{format}</code>.

<p><a id="Unicode-Support"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.2 Unicode Support</h3>

<p>As of version 1.9.17, LaTeX2RTF
has limited unicode support.  LaTeX
files
that use unicode sequences are just emitted directly into the RTF file.<br>
Symbols and odd characters in math sequences may also be converted to
a unicode sequence. Some of them need the STIXGeneral fonts
(see <a href="#Math-and-Special-Symbols">Math and Special Symbols</a>) to be installed on the system
where the rtf file is to be displayed or printed.

   <p>Support for unicode encoded input is activated by the LaTeX command <br>
<code>\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}</code> <br>
or <br>
<code>\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}</code>.

<p><a id="Input-Encoding"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.3 Input Encoding</h3>

<p>It is not necesary to specify the <span class="option">-C</span> 
option if you use <code>\usepackage{isolatin1}</code>
or <code>\documentstyle[isolatin1]{...}</code>. LaTeX2RTF automagically detects these
packages/style options and switches to processing of ISO-Latin1 codes.  The following
encodings are supported: ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865,
decmulti, cp1250, cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9, next,
koi8-r, koi8-u, cp1251, cp855, cp866, maccyr, macukr, utf8, and utf8x.  The encoding used in
RTF files is cp1252.  If cyrillic fonts are present, then these are represented
in the RTF file using cp1251 (Windows Cyrillic).

<p><a id="Language-Support"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.4 Language Support</h3>

<p><a id="index-language-support-3"></a><a name="index-babel-4"></a>
The following languages from the Babel package are supported: afrikaans,
german, nynorsk, spanish, bahasa, dutch, icelandic, polish, swedish,
basque, english, portuges, turkish, brazil, esperanto, irish, romanian,
usorbian, breton, estonian, italian, samin, welsh, catalan, finnish,
latin, scottish, croatian, lsorbian, serbian, czech, french, magyar,
slovak, danish, galician, norsk, slovene.

   <p>The only thing that these files do is to translate various words usually
emitted by LaTeX during processing.  For example, this ensures that the LaTeX2RTF
will provide the correct translation of the word &ldquo;Chapter&rdquo; in
the converted document.

   <p>You can select any of the above languages using the <span class="option">-l</span> option.  This
is not needed if your LaTeX
file contains <code>\usepackage[language]{babel}</code>.

   <p>Encountering the <span class="option">german</span> package or babel option (by H. Partl of the
Vienna University) makes LaTeX2RTF
behave like that: German Quotes, German
Umlauts by <code>"a</code>, etc<small class="enddots">....</small>  This support is programmed directly
into LaTeX2RTF
and supporting similar features for other languages will require
patching the source code.

   <p>There is similar support for <span class="option">french</span> packages.

   <p>There is reasonable support for english, latin1, latin2, and cyrillic languages.

   <p>See <a href="#Language-Configuration">Language Configuration</a>, for details on how to write a <span class="file">language.cfg</span> file
for your language by yourself.

<p><a id="Cross-References"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.5 Cross References</h3>

<p>Cross references include everything that you might expect and then some:
bibliographic citations, equation references, table references, figure
references, and section references.  Section, equation, table and figure references
are implemented by placing RTF bookmarks around the equation number (or table
number or figure number).

   <p>Page references work but are implemented as &ldquo;warm&rdquo; cross-references.  This
means that Word does not automatically update the page references when the file
is opened.  To update the page references you must select the entire document
(in Word) and press <code>F9</code>.

   <p><a id="index-bibliography-5"></a>Bibliographic references currently require that a valid <span class="file">.aux</span> file be
present.  This is where LaTeX2RTF obtains the reference numbers.  It would be
nice if LaTeX2RTF just automatically numbered the references when there was
no <span class="file">.aux</span> file, but LaTeX2RTF does not do this yet.

   <p><a id="index-bibliography_002c-BibTeX-6"></a><a name="index-BibTeX-7"></a>LaTeX2RTF
relies on BibTeX to convert and format bibliographic entries. 
Usually the style file for a particular BibTeX format does not use any special LaTeX
commands and therefore the bibliography file
<span class="file">file.bbl</span> can be processed by LaTeX2RTF
without difficulty. As a consequence, LaTeX2RTF
can handle most bibliography styles without problem.

   <p><a id="index-bibliography_002c-apacite-8"></a><a name="index-bibliography_002c-apalike-9"></a>
<a name="index-bibliography_002c-authordate-10"></a><a name="index-bibliography_002c-harvard-11"></a>
<a name="index-bibliography_002c-natbib-12"></a><a name="index-bibliography_002c-apanat1b-13"></a>
<a name="index-apacite-14"></a><a name="index-apalike-15"></a><a name="index-authordate-16"></a>
<a name="index-harvard-17"></a><a name="index-natbib-18"></a><a name="index-apanat1b-19"></a>
There are several latex style packages that add additional
latex commands to enhance bibliographic formatting. LaTeX2RTF
currently supports the following bibliographic packages:<br>
apacite, apalike, authordate, harvard, natbib (also with apanat1b). 
These packages have many, many options and you may encounter
problems with formatting in special cases.

   <p>As of LaTeX2RTF
1.9.17, the natbib command bibpunct is supported.

   <p>Footnotes are implemented and appear at the bottom of each page. 
<a id="index-footnotes-20"></a>
<a id="index-index-21"></a>Indexing is reasonably-well supported.  The simple mark-up of <code>makeindex</code>
<pre class="example">     \index{topic!subtopic@\textit{subtopic}}
</pre>
   <p>is supported.  The rest of the fancy indexing stuff is not implemented. 
The index is created at the location of the <code>\printindex</code> command. 
When a file with an index is first opened in Word, you must select the
entire file and update the page references and fields by pressing <code>F9</code>.

   <p>Currently, there is no support for <code>\labels</code> of <code>\item</code>s in enumerate environments.

   <p>The conversion of cross-references is not perfect because of the different
mechanisms in the LaTeX and Word worlds.  In particular, if there are
multiple <code>\label</code> in a figure, table, or section environment then only the first
gets processed.  It is also possible to confuse the LaTeX2RTF
in eqnarray environments.

<p><a id="Page-Formatting"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.6 Page Formatting</h3>

<p><a id="index-page-formatting-22"></a><a name="index-geometry-package-23"></a><a name="index-margins-24"></a>
<a name="index-line-spacing-25"></a><a name="index-double-spacing-26"></a><a name="index-setspace-package-27"></a>
LaTeX2RTF will handle some basic page formatting options, including
\doublespacing (as implemented in the setspace package), and the margin
setting options provided by the geometry package including commands in the
ratio, centering and margin families. Not all geometry options are
implemented yet, in part because there are no corresponding rtf commands
for many of them.

<p><a id="Equations"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.7 Equations</h3>

<p><a id="index-equations-28"></a>
There are six separate levels of equation translation based on the -M switch,
see <a href="#LaTeX2RTF-Options">LaTeX2RTF Options</a>. 
Each equation is converted either to an EQ field or to a bitmap
or inserted as raw TeX code in the document or converted to an eps file with the
eps file name inserted in the document text delimited by [###...###].

   <p>This is an interim solution (for some definition of &ldquo;interim&rdquo;). 
Ideally the equations would become OLE equation objects in the
RTF file, but this needs to be implemented.

   <p>Some functions in the EQ fields have two or more parameters with a separator
between each two. Unfortunately, the interpretation of these separators depends
on the country specific settings in the MS Windows system in which the rtf file
is opened. e.g. in English versions of MS Windows, the default parameter separator
is the comma, in German versions the default is the semicolon. If the parameter
in the RTF file does not match the Windows setting, some EQ fields are not
interpreted correctly. You can check and set the separator in [Windows control panel
- country settings - numbers - list separator]. By default, LaTeX2RTF
uses
the comma as separator. If LaTeX2RTF
is called with the command line parameter -S ,
the semicolon is inserted as parameter delimiter.

   <p>Theoretically, according to the Word help file, parentheses `(' or `)' in
mathematical formulas should be escaped (by a preceding backslash). 
Despite this, adding escapes usually produces a worse result than doing nothing. 
If Word displays some formulas with parentheses as &ldquo;Error!&rdquo;, you might try
the -p option as a last resort.

   <p>It is also possible to convert an EQ field generated by LaTeX2RTF to an
Equation Editor object by opening the rtf file in Word and double-clicking on
the equation. However there are bugs in the interface between Word and Equation
Editor which prevent symbols in font Symbol or MTExtra to be converted correctly. 
The full commercial version of the Equation Editor, called MathType, handles
this conversion correctly.

   <p>If you have MathType version 6 or later, an even better way to convert LaTeX
equations to MathType is letting LaTeX2RTF write the LaTeX code of the equations verbatim in the
rtf file (option -M32), then open the rtf file in Word, select the LaTeX code of
an equation, cut it to the clipboard, open MathType, and paste the code. 
MathType will convert the code into an equation. Wilfried tried to automate this
in a Word macro, but this fails because the macro does not wait until MathType is
started and ready to receive the pasted code. Maybe the MathType authors will
give us a hint or provide such a macro.

   <p>MathType can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.dessci.com/">http://www.dessci.com/</a>
(30 day test version).

<p><a id="Math-and-Special-Symbols"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.8 Math and Special Symbols</h3>

<p><a id="index-math-29"></a><a name="index-special-symbols-30"></a>
The way that symbols are converted in the RTF is based on the following
observations.  If the symbol is found in the latin 1 character set, then
the current font is used, else the unicode code is inserted in the rtf code. 
(Implemented since version 2.1.0)

   <p>The means that on the system where the <span class="file">.rtf</span> file is opened, a unicode
font should be available or these glyphs will not be displayed correctly. 
As only the STIX fonts contain all needed characters, these fonts should be
installed on the system where the rtf file is to be displayed or printed.

   <p>Many mathematical and special symbols are directly supported by LaTeX2RTF. 
Less common symbols (not found in the standard font)
are supported by the conversion table in the file <span class="file">direct.cfg</span>,
see <a href="#Direct-Conversion">Direct Conversion</a>.

   <p>Required fonts are:

     <ul>
<li>&ldquo;Times&rdquo; / &ldquo;Times New Roman&rdquo; or &ldquo;Helvetica&rdquo; / &ldquo;Arial&rdquo;,
preferably with Unicode extension (i.e. supporting all European languages
including Cyrillic, Greek, and Hebrew). &ldquo;Times&rdquo; or &ldquo;Times New Roman&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Helvetica&rdquo; or &ldquo;Arial&rdquo; are standard on all systems,
but not their Unicode extension.

     <li>&ldquo;STIXGeneral&rdquo; (4 fonts in plain, italic, bold, bold-italic). These fonts
are available from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/stixfonts/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/stixfonts/</a>.

     <p>Note that while Office 2003 on Vista works correctly with the Open Type
version, it does not on Windows XP (Word 2003 assigns no character
spacing, and Publisher doesn't display the character at all). On
Windows XP, Office 2003 only displays the symbols correctly with the
TrueType (ttf) version of the fonts. But stixfonts.org only supplies
the Open Type (otf) version. 
TrueType versions of the fonts can be downloaded from
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/olegueret/stixfonts-ttf">http://sites.google.com/site/olegueret/stixfonts-ttf</a>.

   </ul>

<p><a id="Tables"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.9 Tables</h3>

<p><a id="index-tables-31"></a>
Conversion of tabular and tabbing environments is somewhat lame.  The
main difficulty is that LaTeX
(and html) will size the columns of
a table automatically.  There is no such feature in RTF.  Consequently,
the conversion defaults to making all the columns have equal size.  This
is suboptimal and should be revised.

   <p>Another way is to use the option -t2
to make latex render them as bitmaps and insert the bitmaps
into the RTF file. This feature was added in version 1.9.19.

<p><a id="Graphics"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.10 Graphics</h3>

<p><a id="index-graphics-32"></a>
There is now rudimentary support for <code>\includegraphics</code>. 
Three file types will be inserted into the RTF file without needing
conversion: <span class="file">.pict</span>, <span class="file">.jpeg</span>, 
and <span class="file">.png</span> files. 
EPS and PDF files are converted to PNG using <code>convert</code> from the
ImageMagick package.  Some options are even handled properly.

<p><a id="Pagestyles"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.11 Pagestyles</h3>

<p><a id="index-pagestyles-33"></a>
If there is no <code>\pagestyle</code> command, the RTF output is generated as with
plain pagestyle, i.e. each page has its page number centered at the bottom.

   <p>You must turn this off with the \pagestyle{empty} command in the LaTeX
file if you don't want pagenumbers. 
The headings and myheadings styles are silently ignored by now. 
The twosided option to the \documentstyle or \documentclass produces the
corresponding RTF tokens. 
Note that these features require RTF Version 1.4.

<p><a id="Hyperlatex"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.12 Hyperlatex</h3>

<p><a id="index-hyperlatex-34"></a>
Hyperlatex support is largely broken at the moment, but continues to improve.

   <p>Otfried Schwarzkopf has created the &ldquo;Hyperlatex Markup Language&rdquo; which is a
&ldquo;little package that allows you to use LaTeX to prepare documents in HTML.&rdquo;
It brings an Emacs lisp program with it to convert the Hyperlatex file to HTML. 
Hyperlatex can be obtained from the CTAN-sites, see <a href="#Obtaining-LaTeX2RTF">Obtaining LaTeX2RTF</a>. 
There are two convenient commands that avoid typing: \link and \xlink that
generate an &ldquo;internal&rdquo; label which then is used in the following \Ref and
\Pageref commands.

   <p>LaTeX makes it possible to write `\link{anchor}[ltx]{label}', which typesets:
`anchor ltx'. LaTeX2RTF does NOT support this aproach since the optional
parameter is thrown away right now, see <a href="#LaTeX2RTF-under-Development">LaTeX2RTF under Development</a>.

   <p>Note that you have to update your <span class="file">.cfg</span> files if you are upgrading, since
there are a lot of HTML oriented commands in Hyperlatex that we simply can `ignore'.

<p><a id="APA-Support"></a>

<h3 class="section">4.13 APA Support</h3>

<p><a id="index-APA-Support-35"></a>
Some APA citation styles are supported, see <a href="#Citation-Commands">Citation Commands</a>

   <p>Support for APA text formatting is only rudimentary at the moment
(headings without numbering). 
If you want to format a document according to APA,
rename cfg/style.cfg to style_sav.cfg
and rename cfg/styleAPA.cfg to style.cfg before starting LaTeX2RTF
.

<p><a id="Configuration"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Configuration</h2>

<p><a id="Input-Processing"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.1 Input processing</h3>

<p><a id="index-input-processing-36"></a><a name="index-direct_002ecfg-37"></a><a name="index-ignore_002ecfg-38"></a>
On processing input LaTeX2RTF first converts the LaTeX special
characters. If it encounters one of the standard commands it is
converted internally. If a command is not known to LaTeX2RTF it is first
looked up in <span class="file">direct.cfg</span> and the RTF code specified there is
output. If not found there it is looked up in the section
<span class="file">ignore.cfg</span>. This file includes a lot of LaTeX
commands that do not affect the output (cross reference information and the like), or
that we are not able or willing to convert to RTF.

   <p>You can use <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span> if you get tired of seeing
<pre class="example">     WARNING: command: `foo' not found - ignored
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and you don't need `foo' in your RTF document. It would be nice to send
your additions to the LaTeX2RTF mailing list for inclusion in later distributions.

   <p>LaTeX2RTF accepts Unix, MS-DOS, and Macintosh line ending codes (\n, \r\n
and \r).  The files it creates get the line ending for the platform on
which LaTeX2RTF was compiled.

   <p>The LaTeX file may have been created with a wide variety of character
sets.  If the LaTeX lacks the <code>\package[codepage]{inputenc}</code>
definition, then you may need to use the command line switch to manually
select the proper code page (see <a href="#Input-Encoding">Input Encoding</a>).

<p><a id="Conditional-Parsing"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.2 Conditional Parsing</h3>

<p><a id="index-Conditional-Parsing-39"></a><a name="index-_0025latex2rtf-40"></a><a name="index-iflatextortf-41"></a>
Starting with LaTeX2RTF 1.9.18, there is a handy method for controlling which content
should be processed by LaTeX or by LaTeX2RTF.  Control is achieved using the
standard <code>\if</code> facility of TeX.  If you include the following line in
the preamble of your document (i.e., before <code>\begin{document}</code>)

<pre class="example">     \newif\iflatextortf
</pre>
   <p>Then you will create a new <code>\iflatextortf</code> command in LaTeX
. 
TeX sets the value of this to <code>false</code> by default.  Now, LaTeX2RTF
internally sets <code>\iflatextortf</code> to be true, and to ensure that
this is always the case, LaTeX2RTF ignores the command <code>\latextortffalse</code>. 
This means that you can control how different applications process your document by

<pre class="example">     \iflatextortf
     This code is processed only by latex2rtf
     \else
     This code is processed only by latex
     \fi
</pre>
   <p>Note that <code>\iflatextortf</code> will only work within a section; you
cannot use this command to conditionally parse code that crosses section
boundaries. Also, it will only work on complete table or figure
environments. Due to the mechanism used by LaTeX2RTF in processing these
environments, at this time the only way to conditionally parse tables
and figures is to include two complete versions of the environment in
question, nested within an appropriate <code>\iflatex2rtf</code> structure.

   <p>LaTeX2RTF
versions 1.9.15 to 1.9.18 had the ability to hide contents from LaTeX

   <p>but expose them to LaTeX2RTF
by starting a line with <code>%latex2rtf:</code>.  This
code was horribly broken, and it was removed.  The same functionality is readily
achieved using the <code>\iflatextortf</code> mechanism.  For example, the old
method allowed

<pre class="example">     %latex2rtf: This line will only appear in the latex2rtf output,
</pre>
   <p>To get the same behavior, define <code>\iflatextortf</code> and use

<pre class="example">     \iflatextortf
     This code is processed only by latex2rtf
     \fi
</pre>
   <p><a id="Output-Formatting"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.3 Output Formatting</h3>

<p>On writing output, LaTeX2RTF generates the operating system specific line ending code
(<code>\n</code> on Unix, <code>\r\n</code> on DOS or Windows), depending on which system
LaTeX2RTF was compiled. 
As both should be legal to any RTF Reader the resulting RTF rendering should
not be affected.

   <p>LaTeX2RTF
does not offer a whole lot of flexibility in how files are translated,
but it does offer some.  This flexibility resides in four files <span class="file">direct.cfg</span>,
<span class="file">ignore.cfg</span>, <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span>, and <span class="file">language.cfg</span>.  These filese
are documented in the next four sections.

<p><a id="Direct-Conversion"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.4 Direct Conversion</h3>

<p>The file <span class="file">direct.cfg</span> is used for converting LaTeX
commands by simple text replacement. The format consists of lines with a LaTeX
command with backslash followed by comma. The rest of the line 
until a <span class="samp">.</span> character will be written
to the RTF file when the command is found in the LaTeX file. Lines
starting with a <span class="samp">#</span> character are ignored. 
After the <span class="samp">.</span> everything is ignored
to end of line. To select a specific font use <code>*fontname*</code>, where
<code>fontname</code> be defined in <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span>. 
To write the <span class="samp">*</span> character use <span class="samp">**</span>.

<pre class="verbatim">
\bigstar,{\u8727**}.
\copyright,\'a9.
</pre>

   <p>In general, specific fonts should not be specified in this file. There is a
mechanism to do this, but it turns out that this is not as useful as originally
thought.  The main reason that this fails is because the conversion of equations
from Word fields to Equation Editor objects is buggy.  The consequence is that
to have symbols show up properly, they must be encoded differently when the Symbol
and MT Extra fonts are used &mdash; depending on whether Word fields are active or
not.  It was all very tedious to figure out a mechanism that was &ldquo;least broken.&rdquo;

<p><a id="Ignore-Command"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.5 Ignore Command</h3>

<p>The file <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span> is used for defining how to ignore specific commands. 
This file is used for recognition of LaTeX variables, user defined variables, and
some simple commands. All variables are ignored but the converter must know the
names to correctly ignore assignments to variables. Lines in this file consist
of a variable name with backslash, followed by comma and the type of the
variable followed by <span class="samp">.</span>. Possible types are

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">NUMBER</span><dd>simple numeric value
<br><dt><span class="samp">MEASURE</span><dd>numeric value with following unit of measure
<br><dt><span class="samp">OTHER</span><dd>ignores anything to the first character after <span class="samp">=</span> and from there to next
space. e.g., <code>\setbox\bak=\hbox</code>
<br><dt><span class="samp">COMMAND</span><dd>ignores anything to next <span class="samp">\</span> and from there to the occurence of anything
but a letter e.g., <code>\newbox\bak</code>
<br><dt><span class="samp">SINGLE</span><dd>ignores single command e.g., <code>\noindent</code>
<br><dt><span class="samp">PARAMETER</span><dd>ignores a command with one parameter e.g., <code>\foo{bar}</code>
<br><dt><span class="samp">PACKAGE</span><dd>does not produce a Warning message if PACKAGE is encountered, e.g.,
`<code>\kleenex,PACKAGE.</code>' ignores `<code>\usepackage{kleenex}</code>'
<br><dt><span class="samp">ENVCMD</span><dd>intended to process contents of unknown environment as if it were
plain LaTeX
, e.g. `<code>\environ,ENVCMD.</code>' <br>
Therefore `<code>\begin{environ} text
\end{environ}</code>' would be converted to `text'. 
Doesn't work in LaTeX2RTF
version 2.1.0 up to and including 2.3.0. 
<br><dt><span class="samp">ENVIRONMENT</span><dd>ignores contents of that environment, 
e.g., with `<code>\ifhtml,ENVIRONMENT.</code>&rdquo;,
`<code>\begin{ifhtml} text \end{ifhtml}</code>' ignores `text'. 
</dl>

   <p>The types are in upper case exactly as above. Do not use spaces. Lines starting
with a <span class="samp">#</span> character are ignored. After the <span class="samp">.</span> everything is ignored to end of
line. Example:
<pre class="example">     \pagelength,MEASURE.
</pre>
   <p><a id="Font-Configuration"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.6 Font Configuration</h3>

<p>The file <span class="file">fonts.cfg</span> contains the font name mapping.  For example, this
file determines what font is used to represent <code>\rm</code> characters in the RTF file.

   <p>A line consists of a font name in LaTeX followed by comma and a font
name in RTF. The end is marked by a <span class="samp">.</span>. No spaces are allowed. The
LaTeX font will be converted to the RTF font when it is found
in the LaTeX file. If multiple translations for the same LaTeX
font are specified, only the first is used. All fonts in a LaTeX
file that are not in this file will be mapped to the default font. All RTF fonts
listed in this file will be in every RTF file header whether used or
not.  Lines starting with a <span class="samp">#</span> character are ignored. After the
<span class="samp">.</span> everything is ignored to end of line.

   <p>To add a RTF font not used as substitute for a LaTeX
font &mdash; for example a Symbol font used
in <span class="file">direct.cfg</span> &mdash; use a dummy LaTeX
name like in the following
<pre class="example">     Dummy3,MathematicalSymbols.
</pre>
   <p>Make sure you use the correct font name. Take care of spaces in font names. The
default fonts are named Roman <code>\rm</code>, Slanted <code>\sl</code>, Sans Serif
<code>\sf</code>, Typewriter <code>\tt</code>, or Calligraphic <code>\cal</code>.

<p><a id="Language-Configuration"></a>

<h3 class="section">5.7 Language Configuration</h3>

<p>The file(s) <span class="file">language.cfg</span> control the translation of LaTeX
's &ldquo;hardcoded&rdquo; sectioning names. 
The standard LaTeX styles have some fixed Title names like `Part', `Reference'
or `Bibliography' that appeared in English or German in the output with the
original versions of LaTeX2RTF.

   <p>It is unlikely that you will need to create a new <span class="file">language.cfg</span> file. 
However, just look at one of the existing files and follow the pattern. 
The format is really simple.

<p><a id="Error-Messages-and-Logging"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">6 Error Messages and Logging</h2>

<p>As stated in the Debugging section, LaTeX2RTF provides a means to control
the amount of debugging information through the <span class="option">-d#</span> switch. 
By using a debugging level of 4, you can get a pretty good idea of what
LaTeX command caused the problem and what line that command might be
found on. Warnings and error messages are output to stderr and by default
listed in the console window. They can be redirected to a file
&ldquo;latex2rtf.log&rdquo; by appending <code>2&gt;latex2rtf.log</code> to the command line.

     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">Fatal error messages</span><dd>indicate a bug in the source code. PLEASE report them, if they do not
apear in the documentation (see <a href="#Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</a>).

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Error messages</span><dd>always abort the program and are caused by conditions that prevent
further conversion of the input file.  Typically this is cause by LaTeX2RTF
getting hopelessly confused by the number of braces in the LaTeX file.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Warning messages</span><dd>inform you, that there is some conversion loss from LaTeX
to RTF, or that the output file has some restrictions on some RTF Readers. Most of these
warnings can be supressed by add the offending command to the <span class="file">ignore.cfg</span>
file. 
</dl>

   <p>Error and Warning messages should follow the GNU Coding standards, i.e. they
have the format
<pre class="example">     inputfile':line: Error|Warning: message
</pre>
   <p>You can also control the level of debugging output by inserting <code>\verbositylevel{#}</code>
in the LaTeX file.  This is very handy if you have a large LaTeX file
that is failing in only a small section.  For example,
<pre class="example">     problem free latex file ....
     \verbositylevel{5}
     problematic code
     \verbositylevel{0}
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will cause a huge amount of debugging information to be emitted
for the problematic code.

   <p>Error reporting and logging still has many inconsistencies, but it
gets better with each release. 
Don't try to make any sense in debugging levels above 4, these are for my
own delight only and can change significantly between versions.

   <p>The <span class="file">inputfile</span> may be incorrectly identified if it is incorporated
through <code>\input</code> or <code>\include</code>.  The line may be also be wrong
at times.  See <a href="#Known-Bugs">Known Bugs</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">7 History &amp; Copyright</h2>

<p><a id="index-History-of-the-program-42"></a><a name="index-Copyright-issues-43"></a>
In 1994 the first Version of LaTeX2RTF was written by Fernando Dorner and Andreas Granzer of
the Vienna University supervised by Ralf Schlatterbeck in a one-semester course. They
created a simple LaTeX parser and added most of the infrastructure for the program. 
This was version 1.0 of LaTeX2RTF.  In 1995, work on LaTeX2RTF was continued in another
one-semester course by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard Trisko. The result was LaTeX2RTF
version 1.5.  Ralf Schlatterbeck (ralf &ldquo;at&rdquo; zoo.priv.at) maintained and 
extended LaTeX2RTF until 1998.

   <p>In 1998 Georg Lehner (jorge_lehner &ldquo;at&rdquo; gmx.net) found the reference to LaTeX2RTF
on the
<a href="http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/index.html">TeX Conversion Webpage</a> of
Wilfried Hennings and added some functionality and took
over the maintainence of the program.  The last version release by Georg is 1.8aa. 
The bulk of development post 1.8aa was done by Scott Prahl. 
Wilfried Hennings now coordinates the development of the program and maintains the project
on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a> where there are also
(low volume) mailing lists for users and developers. Mailing via one of these lists requires
subscription to the list (to prevent spam). 
For subscription to these lists visit the page:
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/latex2rtf-users">users list</a>
or
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/latex2rtf-developers">developers list</a>

   <p>As of October 2014, version 2.3.9 of LaTeX2RTF is available.

   <p>The contents of this manual were composed by copying shamelessly what was
available in the original sources and documentation.

<li>LaTeX2RTF ignores some optional parameters of <code>\documentstyle</code>
<li>Add the code to produce the corresponding chapter, section, and page
numbering with headings and myheadings pagestyles. Implement
<code>\markboth</code> and <code>\markright</code>. 
<li>To support <code>\tableofcontents</code> there would be two approaches:
Transfer sectioning information, title text and then produce page
numbers by the rtf- reader. Scan and label all of the sectioning
commands while reading and then construct the sectioning information
using these labels. Needs two passes on LaTeX input.

<h3 class="section">8.3 Known Bugs</h3>

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The first parameter of a \link{anchor}[ltx]{label} is converted to
the rtf-output. Label is stored to hyperref for later use, the optional
parameter is ignored. [ltx] should be processed as Otfried recommends
it, to use for exclusive LaTeX output.e.g:
\link{readhere}[~\Ref]{explaining: chapter}. Since
{explaining:chapter} is yet read by LaTeX and hyperlatex when [...] 
is evaluated it produces the correct reference. LaTeX2RTF is only
strolling from left to right through the text and can't remember what
she will see in the future. 
<li>The diagnostics routine does not output the correct (actual)
input filename. (`.aux', `.bbl', <code>\input</code>).
     </ol>

<p><a id="Reporting-Bugs"></a>

<h3 class="section">8.4 Reporting Bugs</h3>

<p>Report bugs to to the bug tracking system at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</a>. 
Only report bugs for the latest version of LaTeX2RTF that is available. 
Please provide the following information and observe the following
guidelines when reporting a bug in the program:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>State the version of LaTeX2RTF
that you are using.  You can get the version by
specifying the <span class="option">-V</span> option to LaTeX2RTF
.

     <li>Specify the your operating system and version. Be sure to check the file `Makefile'
for settings that may be specific to your machine, especially for some versions of SunOS
there may be settings which are needed to compile successfully. Do this before submitting
a bug report.

     <li>If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include a short
LaTeX file along with a description of the problem.  Isolating the bug into a small
LaTeX file does two things.  First, it provides a file that can be used to test future
versions of LaTeX2RTF and second, it certainly improves the chances that the bug will get
some attention.  Do not send me large LaTeX or RTF files, I simply do not have the time
to wade through large files to search for a bug!

     <li>Be patient. I am maintaining the program in my free time. I did not
write most of the code. Often I do not have the time to answer to your
question. I will, however, try to fix reported bugs in upcoming releases.

Note: inclusion in this list does not mean that a command is fully and

to encourage developers to note any departures from the behaviour that
LaTeX users will expect. The location of the commands is noted to
