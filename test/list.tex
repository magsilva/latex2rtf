The enumerate environment with labels
\begin{enumerate}
\item[frog~~~] this is a frog
\item[spider~~~] this is an arachnid
\item this has no label
\item[] this has an empty label
\end{enumerate}
Here is some text so that the paragraph break after this
is more clear than it is without this sentence which of
course must be very long so that it will reach the end of
the line and I see what is happening very clearly.

Now to test nested environments.  First the enumerate 
environment without labels
\begin{enumerate}
\item this is the first sublist
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item this 1a a frog
   \item this 1b an arachnid
   \item this 1c a bone
   \end{enumerate}
\item this is the second sublist
   \begin{itemize}
   \item this a sub sub list
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item this is 2 (a) frog
      \item this is 2 (b) an arachnid
      \item this is 2 (c) bone
      \end{enumerate}
   \item this is an arachnid
   \item this another sub sub list
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item this is 2 (a) frog
      \item this is 2 (b) an arachnid
      \item this is 2 (c) bone
      \end{enumerate}
   \end{itemize}
\item this is 3 an arachnid
\item this is 4 the third sublist
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item this (a) is sub sub list
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item  i. this is a frog
          \begin{enumerate}
          \item this A. is a frog
          \item this B. is an arachnid
          \item this C. is a bone
          \end{enumerate}
      \item this is ii. an arachnid
      \item this is iii. a bone
      \end{enumerate}
   \item this is an arachnid Here is some text so that the paragraph break after this
is more clear than it is without this sentence which of
course must be very long so that it will reach the end of
the line and I see what is happening very clearly.

   \item this another sub sub list Here is some text so that the paragraph break after this
is more clear than it is without this sentence which of
course must be very long so that it will reach the end of
the line and I see what is happening very clearly.

      \begin{enumerate}
      \item this i. is a frog
      \item this ii. is an arachnid
      \item this iii. is a bone
      \item this iv. is a frog
      \item this v. is an arachnid
      \item this vi. is a frog
      \item this vii. is an arachnid
      \item this viii. is a bone
      \item this ix. is a frog
      \item this x. is an arachnid
      \end{enumerate}
   \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Here is some text so that the paragraph break after this
is more clear than it is without this sentence which of
